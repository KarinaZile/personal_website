Thank you so much for considering working with me.
Let's learn from each other!
Here are some things I'd like you to know about me:

1. **I am not British**

    I always say exactly what I mean, which in theory should make it easy to work with me. 
    Unfortunately, this also means that I don't sound as polite as British people do.
    For example, where a British person would say "Perhaps, if you do have the time, you could possibly do this, please?", I say "You do it!" and expect you to tell me if you don't have the time.
    I also don't say "thank you" as often as I probably should. 
    In my mind it is obvious that if we are working together towards a common goal, then we are grateful for each other's contributions, and so no extra acknowledgement of that is required. 


    I understand that everyone is different and I'm happy to adapt my communication style. 
    I want to become a person that you would be delighted to work with, so please do tell me if I sound (in person or in writing) rude, dismissive or otherwise unpleasant. 
    Please help me grow, and I will do the same for you.


2. **I don't like positive feedback**

    To me "Well done!" sounds like "I didn't have time to look at your work". 
    I love criticism because it allows me to improve.
    I love when people point out my mistakes.
    Please don't ever try to avoid offending me, I am eager for feedback, both professional and personal.

    As a consequence, you might find my feedback overly critical or even conclude that I generally have a negative attitude towards everything. 
    Please do let me know, and I will make a conscious effort to emphasize positive feedback that I often skip because I myself find it pointless. 
    This is just how my brain works - it is obsessed with information density.
    "Well done!" could mean either that you had no time to look at my work or that you have no suggestions for how to improve it; either way I can't learn anything from it.


3. **My background is in computer science**
    
    My academic background is in mathematics and computer science.
    Since typing mathematical equations in *what you see is what you get* formats (Google Docs, Word and similar) is a pain, I fell in love with *what you see is what you type* formats.
    I share documents as pdfs (generated from LaTeX or html) and my notes as plain text or through WorkFlowy.
    This is not to make your life more difficult, this is because using *what you see is what you get* formats is a real pain for me.
    To collaborate, I can copy-paste content into a Google Doc, if I absolutely have to.

    I don't use WhatsApp and I don't have a Zoom account, because cyber security is important for me.
    If you want to learn more about computer related stuff or about my productivity hacks, I am happy to chat about it.
    Please let me know which formats and communication methods work best for you, and I'll try to adapt as much as possible.
    As long as it doesn't involve installing WhatsApp.


4. **Please let me know if it's urgent**

    I always try to reply to messages (emails, Signal, etc.) as soon as possible, but sometimes there is a delay because I am travelling or working towards a tight deadline.
    I am swapping sim cards often, depending on which country I am working from, hence reaching me by phone is usually not the best option.
    If your message is urgent, please let me know by sending an email with a subject starting with the word URGENT. 
    I reply to these types of messages immediately (or as soon as I reach an internet connection).

    This applies not only to mission critical stuff.
    For example, if you are booking accomodation in a city I've been to before and would like a recommendation about the best neighbourhood to stay in, I'd love to share my tips while they are still useful.
    So please don't hesitate to prepend an email subject or a Signal message with the word URGENT if a prompt reply will make a difference to you.
    I'll do the same, if you don't mind.

I decided to write this article because I received a lot of bad advice when I was figuring out what to do with my career.
Here I will share <a href="/misc/unconventional-career-advice/#bad-advice" target="_self">the bad advice I got</a>; provide <a href="/misc/unconventional-career-advice/#good-advice" target="_self">my unconventional career advice</a>; suggest some ideas for <a href="/misc/unconventional-career-advice/#direction" target="_self">for choosing your mission</a>; and conclude with <a href="/misc/unconventional-career-advice/#today" target="_self">things you can achieve today</a>.

### <a name="bad-advice"></a>Don't listen to bad advice

Here are some examples of bad career advice I got:

**"Now that you have a PhD, you must find a job in this area in which you are now an expert."**
It is in fact the opposite.
Every academic degree and every new skill or experience you gain gives you more options for your career, not less.
You should not limit yourself to a particular set of jobs, instead you should evaluate all options available to you.
Please don't listen to anyone who mentions "wasting your degree".

**"You should do a startup."**
This advice implies that having your own startup is the goal.
In my opinion it is important to first figure out what you want to achieve with your career and then find a way to achieve it, which might turn out to be a startup.

**"You should work for Facebook."** 
Nothing wrong with this advice as such, apart from in this specific context.
My friend was furious.
Trying to ignite anger in me too, he made me watch videos presenting evidence that Facebook's political interference erodes democracy around the world and leads to "incorrect" results of elections and referendums.
(I am not going to share my opinions about Facebook here.)
To my astonishment, that same friend just a couple of days later said, in response to me looking for jobs, "you are brilliant, you should apply for the best jobs, you should work for Facebook". 
I believe you shouldn't apply for jobs with companies that in your opinion do "awful things", even if they pay well and even if having their brand on your CV will make it more attractive.

Sometimes asking the wrong questions is equally unhelpful:

**"Would you like to work for a startup or a big company?"** 
Again, in my opinion it is important to first figure out what you want to achieve with your career.
Based on that decision, the right thing to do might be joining a startup, joining a team in a big company, working for the government or becoming a freelancer. 
If you first narrow your options and then look for opportunities in this specific subset, you might overlook a career uniquely suited for your set of values, interests and personality.

**"Which country would you like to work in?"** 
You guessed it - it is important to first figure out what you want to achieve with your career.
Based on that decision, you might end up working in windy countries (if your career is focused on wind power) or in countries with high prevalence of a specific disease (if your career is dedicated to eradicating it).
Chances are you might be free to work remotely from any country with fast internet.

My own advice for myself was no better:

**"I must make sure that I become hyper-employable so that I can find a job within days in any country."** 
In the words of Nassim Nicholas Taleb (this is not an endorsement, I disagree with a lot of things he said): "People are owned by the idea that they need to be employable. The employable person [lives in] fear of upsetting not just their employer, but other potential [future] employers."
There are a lot of good goals you can set for yourself - learn more languages, gain experience in a particular industry, become an expert on a topic through relevant work or education.
Having a diverse set of skills, deep knowledge in particular areas and a wide professional network will inevitably make you employable.
Aiming for a "perfect CV" that contains no gaps, no jobs that you quit "too soon" and no "falls" down a career ladder is a recipe for unhappy life and often a less impactful career.

The pivotal moment for me was when I stumbled upon 80,000 hours, an organization dedicated to helping people use their career to have a positive impact on the world.
It wasn't any of [their career advice][1] in particular, but the idea behind their advice - **using my career to have a positive impact on the world**.
This organization gave me an unspoken permission to first decide what I want to achieve with my career, instead of chasing the best job I can get just to prove to myself that I am employable.



### <a name="good-advice"></a>You can change the world

I know a lot of people who have well paid jobs.
They can afford everything they want and they often complain to me that their life is meaningless.
Based on that, my goal was to have a life that I find meaningful. 

The first option is to [earn to give][2] and/or to volunteer in spare time.
That is what I would have done if I would't have this unspoken permission from [80,000 hours][3] to use my career to have a positive impact on the world.

The second option is to change the world yourself. 
Instead of donating to your favorite charity or volunteering for it, you can research the causes of the situation the charity is trying to address and do something about it.
That might mean joining that charity as part of the team, or doing a startup, or working for the government, or going (back) to university, or doing a PhD, or perhaps [setting up a new department at a university][4]. 
The list is endless and it might even involve doing things that have not been done before.

...

<!-- Once you've chosen you mission (more on that in the next section), the next step might be to get a job. 
My advice is to look for organisation you might want to work with, not for open positions listed online.
I've heard from a lot of people both in industry and in academia that finding a job is increadibly hard. 
I would believe them, if it wouldn't be for my conversations with CEOs and PIs

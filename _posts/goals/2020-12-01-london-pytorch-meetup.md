The London PyTorch Meetup was created by me and the amazing [Paul Dowling][1]. Our aim is to bring together London-based PyTorch users as well as other people working/interested in ML and AI. We strive to provide a platform where people can share their experiences, make new friends, find advice and initiate collaborations. We make an effort to connect people who are just starting their journey into ML with ML professionals, and to connect people who are new to London (or simply visiting) with developers based in London. For each event we select an exciting line-up of speakers with talks covering PyTorch applications in a broad range of industries and cutting edge research. We aim to strike a balance between creating a welcoming atmosphere for people new to ML and having in depth talks with snippets of code frequently featuring on the slides.

If you are in London (even if only briefly) and you are interested in ML, please do join us for one of our events to meet a diverse crowd from industry, academia and start-up worlds. Beers, smiles and new ideas are provided for free: [London PyTorch Meetup][2].

meta_description: My goals are to reduce the environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste, and to minimise the impact of waste on human and animal health. Currently I am working towards increasing the coverage of waste collection services in low and medium income countries. To achieve this, I focus on three activities - researching technologies for waste collection, treatment, recycling and disposal; networking with all stakeholders from consumer goods producers to waste management companies; collaborating with waste management and technology companies, governments and funders to enable them to achieve more positive impact.

My goals are to reduce the environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste, and to minimise the impact of waste on human and animal health. 
Currently I am working towards increasing the coverage of waste collection services in low and medium income countries. 
To achieve this, I focus on three activities - researching technologies for waste collection, treatment, recycling and disposal; networking with all stakeholders from consumer goods producers to waste management companies; collaborating with waste management and technology companies, governments and funders to enable them to achieve more positive impact. 
I am using my broad expertise in waste management to connect the pieces of the puzzle - waste management companies, existing technologies and available funding - and thus create long-term waste management solutions.

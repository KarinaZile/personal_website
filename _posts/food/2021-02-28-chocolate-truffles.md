### Ingredients:

* 300g double cream
* 50g butter
* 300g dark chocolate
* 30g cacao powder
* a shot of rum


### Methods:

* Cut chocolate into small pieces.
* Gently heat the cream and butter cut into pieces until butter melts completely (that means the cream is hot enough to melt chocolate too).
* Remove from the heat, add all chocolate and cacao powder into the cream, gently mix, let it sit and melt for a moment. Add rum and mix gently until all chocolate has melted. Stop mixing as soon as the mixture looks smooth and glossy. Do not overmix, otherwise the emulsion will split. If the fats start to separate, handblender the emulsion back together.
* Refrigerate the mixture until cold.
* Use a spoon and your hands to make small balls of chocolate mixture, arrange them on a plate.
* Refrigerate the plate with the truffles until cold.
* Put a bit of cacao powder in a jar, add several truffles, close the lid and shake to coat the truffles. Proceed until all the truffles are coated. Store them in the fridge.

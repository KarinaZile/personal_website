### Ingredients:

* 260g carrots
* 4 oranges
* 100g walnuts
* 230g dark muscovado sugar
* 230g flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoons ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves
* 3 eggs
* 145g vegetable oil
* 200g full-fat cream cheese
* 50g icing sugar

### Methods:

* Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease an 18cm loose-bottomed round cake tin.
* Grate the carrots, grate zest from 2 oranges, chop walnuts. Put these and muscovado sugar into a large bowl.
* Separately mix flour, baking powder and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves, or any subset of these).
* Lightly beat the eggs, combine with oil.
* Add flour mix to the carrot mix and stir until well combined. Add the egg mixture and stir until well combined.  
* Pour into the cake tin and bake in the oven for 35-60 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
* Make candied orange peels: peel 2 oranges with vegetable peeler, cut the peels into thin stripes, add juice of 1 orange and a bit of muscovado sugar, simmer until caramelised.
* Make the icing: handblender cream cheese with icing sugar and a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice.

**Serving suggestions:** Let the cake cool completely, put icing on top and decorate with candied orange peels. Or if you are in a rush, decorate the cake with candied orange peels as it comes out of the oven and serve the icing on the side.

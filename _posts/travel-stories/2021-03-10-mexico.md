### Reasons to go:

##### 1. Mayan Civilization

* Zona Arqueológica de Uxmal - absolutely fascinating, loads to explore and much less crowded than other more popular places.
* Teotihuacán - most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas. In the first half of the 1st century CE Teotihuaca was at least the sixth largest city in the world with about 125,000 people. About an hour bus ride to "Los piramides" from Terminal Norte in Mexico City.
* Zona Arqueológica de Yaxchilán - only accessible by boat, once you get there it feels other-worldly.
* Zona Arqueológica Palenque - expensive and crowded, but totally worth it. There are many things I've not found anywhere else.
* Zona Arqueológica de Monte Albán


##### 2. Mexican cities

* [Mexico City][1] - a big city with loads of things to discover.
* San Cristóbal de las Casas - a highland city with a high proportion of indigenous people. Do not miss [Iglesia de San Juan][2] in Chamula and [Romerillo Cemetery][3] - these are unique places, there is nothing like them anywhere else in Mexico or indeed anywhere else.
* Oaxaca city - beautiful city, great food, home of Mezcal. I could not shake off the feeling that everything felt "for tourists". Head to Barrio de Xochimilco for street art and a nice neighbourhood vibe.
* Guadalajara - a city that truly comes alive on Sundays during [Vía Recreactiva][8]. Colonia Americana is the best neighbourhood to be based in.
* Santiago de Querétaro - a picturesque city not far from Mexico City. I much preferred it to frequently recommended destinations like Puebla city and [Pueblos Mágicos][9] that I failed to appreciate.



##### 3. Volcanoes

* [El Chichón][4] - the 1982 eruption left a 1km wide crater housing an [acidic crater lake][5] and some active fumaroles.
* Nevado de Toluca - beautiful area for hiking.
* Volcán Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl


##### 4. Haciendas

* Hacienda Yaxcopoil is a great place to learn about haciendas, the crops they grew and the machinery they used.
* Hacienda San Pedro Ochil is now a restaurant where you can enjoy good food in a spectacular setting.


##### 5. Other stuff

* Street art - everywhere. Best ones I found were in Mexico city, Barrio de Xochimilco in Oaxaca city, [Barrio de Guadalupe][7] in San Miguel de Allende, grand murals on highrises outside La Cevicheria Tabasco in Villahermosa, around Iglesia de Santa Inés in Puebla city.s
* Cenotes - natural sinkholes resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater. There are very many of them.
* Las Coloradas - salt flats full of red-coloured algae, plankton and brine shrimp that give the water it's bright pink colour. Flamingos frequent this place. The best time to visit is on a windy day at about 2pm.
* Beaches. My favourite ones are Xcacel Área Natural Protegida Estatal, beaches in Reserva de la Biósfera Sian Ka'an and Puerto Morelos on the Caribbean coast. El Cuyo on the Gulf of Mexico coast; if you are there, visit El Chile Gordo - one of the best restaurants in the country. Zipolite on the Pacific coast is the best nudist beach in the country.
* [Grutas Calcehtok][6] - exploring caves with a guide.





### Local specialities:

* Mezcal
* Tequila. In Tequila town (about 2 hour bus from Central Vieja bus station in Guadalajara) you can visit tequila distilleries and learn about the process. 
* Huitlacoche - a fungus that infects corn plants, it's delicious when cooked in traditional dishes.
* Nopales - edible Opuntia cacti. You can find them in tacos and other dishes.
* Jamaica - you'll find it everywhere in agua fresca, but try to find it in tacos or other dishes where you actually get to eat the flowers themselves.


### Tips:
* Sim cards: Telcel has the best coverage across the country. I bought a "recycled" Telcel sim card from Oxxo. No passport/documents required, insert sim into your phone and it works instantly, top up online as needed.
* ATMs normally charge per withdrawal, regardless of how much you take out. Both Santander and citibanamex work well, they allow to withdraw up to MXN 9,000 for about MXN 35 fee.

## Reasons to go


### 1. Cities

* [London](/travel-stories/london/) and [it's neighbourhoods](/travel-stories/london-parts/)
* Edinburgh

### 2. Hiking in the Lake District

* Striding Edge - ridge walk to Helvellyn
* Crinkle Crags
* Hardknott Roman Fort
* Scafell Pike
* Buttermere hike from Buttermere village, up to Red Pike, along the ridge to High Stile, and back along the north-east side of Buttermere lake. Beware of loose small rocks that make some steep parts of the route perilous, regardless if you do this hike in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.


## Tips

* Trainline app is the best place to see all UK trains, it's not free but it's usually worth it.

## Reasons to go:

### 1. Cities

#### 1.1 [London](/travel-stories/london/) and [it's neighbourhoods](/travel-stories/london-parts/)

#### 1.2 Edinburgh

#### 1.3 Bath

* The Roman Baths
* Bath Abbey, decorated with carvings of [angels climbing the ladders](https://curiousrambler.com/the-upside-down-angels-of-bath-abbey/)
* Paxton & Whitfield - great cheese shop
* City's unique architecture, good examples include The Circus and The Royal Crescents
* Still on my to-visit list: Museum of Bath Architecture list

Outside Bath:
* Stonehenge and Avebury (which is still on my to-visit list)
* Lacock village that is a famous filming location for a reason





### 2. Hiking in the Lake District

* Striding Edge - ridge walk to Helvellyn
* Crinkle Crags
* Hardknott Roman Fort
* Scafell Pike
* Buttermere hike from Buttermere village, up to Red Pike, along the ridge to High Stile, and back along the north-east side of Buttermere lake. Beware of loose small rocks that make some steep parts of the route perilous, regardless if you do this hike in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.


## Tips

* Trainline app is the best place to see all UK trains. The app is free to use to track trains in real time, but you pay commision if you buy tickets through the app. It makes my life so much easier, that I'm ok with paying the commision.

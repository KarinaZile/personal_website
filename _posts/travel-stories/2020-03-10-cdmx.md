### Neighbourhood to explore:
* Condesa and neighbouring Hipódromo and Roma Norte.
* Coyoacán
* Centro Histórico where [buildings are sinking at an astonishing rate][1]. As it starts to get dark, head to Alameda Central park for an unbeatable atmosphere.

<!-- ### Reasons to go:
* Street art. -->


### Tips:
* Best area to stay in: Condesa.
* Look for events on [Local][2] and [TimeOut][3].
* To learn about life on the periphery of the city, I enjoyed reading [LIMITS][4] by Feike de Jong.

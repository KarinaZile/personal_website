### Reasons to go:

##### 1. Neighbourhoods
* Condesa and neighbouring Hipódromo and Roma Norte. Many would say it's the greatest neighbourhood in the world. My happiest memories are tacos at Tacos Hola El Güero, vegan tacos at Por siempre vegana 2, mushroom-based vegan food at Los Loosers, freshly squeezed juices at Loncheria limo limon.
* Centro Histórico where [buildings are sinking at an astonishing rate][1]. Visit Templo Mayor and, as it starts to get dark, head to Alameda Central park for an unbeatable atmosphere.
* Coyoacán. Many buildings on Avenida Francisco Rosa are open to the public (for free) even though it doesn't look like it from the outside. Visit Fonoteca Nacional, Casa de Cultura Jesús Reyes Heroles and others. My happiest memories are vegetarian food at Vege Taco, Restaurante Paraiso Vegetariano and La Pitahaya Vegana (much more expensive, but give it a try once), hot chocolate at Tierra Garat, drinks at Mezcalero Coyoacan, working from Cafebrería El Péndulo with a piece of cake and a tea, reading a book on the lawn of the Cineteca Nacional de Mexico (the best place to see interesting movies). 
* Xochimilco is an experience. It is incredibly touristy, but mostly popular with Mexican tourists. Bring a picnic and jump into a collectivo boat at Embarcadero Nuevo Nativitas Xochimilco.



##### 2. Other stuff
* World class street art is abundant throughout the city.
* Juice bars that offer freshly squeezed goodness for very cheap. I was not able to find juice bars anywhere else in Mexico, so make the most of them while you are here.



### Tips:
* Best area to stay - Condesa.
* Look for events on [Local][2] and [TimeOut][3].
* To learn about life on the periphery of the city, I enjoyed reading [LIMITS][4] by Feike de Jong.

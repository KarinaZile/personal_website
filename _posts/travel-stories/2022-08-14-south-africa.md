## Reasons to go:

### 1. Kruger National Park

Almost 20,000 square kilometers (bigger than the whole of Eswatini) of unique ecosystems teaming with animals. 
The best way to explore the park is in your own (rented) car.
Driving is allowed only during daylight hours; average speed 25km/h.
In my opinion the best time to visit is in November - it's spring time in South Africa and many animals have babies.

Use [this online guide](https://www.krugerpark.co.za/Krugerpark_Travel_Guide-travel/explore-kruger-top-10-kruger-park-self-drives.html) to get a rough idea of which parts you want to see, and use [this map](https://www.krugerpark.co.za/dnl/knp-camps-gates-map.pdf) to make good accomodation choices. 
Once you arrive, buy the latest edition of Kruger Park Map & Guide (I hate paper copies of anything, but I did not regret this purchase).

A couple of beautiful drives just outside the park: Panorama route (takes the whole day) and the scenic drive from Malelane Gate of the park to Kruger Mpumalanga Airport along the N4.

    Mouth trail 1 hour 1 km to visit SUSPENSION bridge and lookout point. The Viewpoint – after the last suspension bridge there is a trail that climbs up all the way to the top of the mountain. The views from there are stunning but the trail is quite challenging, especially the way up, it takes about 1.5 hours to go up and down to the bridge.

    Waterfall trail 3-4 hours 3km visit Guano Cave.  The Waterfall hike – the trail starts at the caravan park, goes along the coast to the waterfall and the pool. It takes about 2-3h return. The route involves some rock hopping and a little bit of climbing, not suitable for hiking with small children.

    https://winetram.co.za/hop-on-hop-off/   https://winetram.co.za/2017/07/choose-perfect-wine-tram-route/
    One person said once (https://somewhere-in-between.com/cape-town-the-best-franschhoek-wine-tram-route/) that the purple/orange is "higher in the mountains with better scenery". It is certainly further away that all the others on the map, and it does have real tram for some of it (not bus). Shall we do that on Saturday, then wing Sunday? Maybe the hike in the morning, then just pay a taxi driver to go to 2-3 more in the afternoon?


Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden - on my list



SEE BOOKLET 

 -->


### <a name="drakensberg"></a> 3. Drakensberg

* Sentinel Peak Hike to Tugela Falls (via Chain Ladder Route) is amazing. If you have time, also try hikes starting from Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge.
* Lesotho has a lot of breathtaking views. For example, Sani pass and Mafika Lisiu Pass. Beware, there are no can openers in the country; if you didn't bring it, you won't be able to buy one.
* Dragon Rock Reptile and Nature Park - a wonderful place where you can handle snakes.
* Benvie Garden is great.
* In nearby Durban, three things are not to be missed: Durban botanical garden, The Glenwood Bakery and the beach.



### 4. Cape Town

Best neighbourhood to stay in is Sea Point, near Sunset Beach. There are loads of great food places and a wonderful running route along the ocean. 

Hiking:
* Lion's Head hike - so satisfying I did it twice in the same week. 
* Table Mountain hike, from the Platteklip Gorge Starting Point.
* A hike from Sandy Bay Parking area to Sandy Bay nudist beach and to Bos 400 shipwreck (look for "Ou Schip" on Google maps).
* Still on my to-visit list: Cape of the Good Hope national park, Cape Point and Diaz Beach.

Other stuff:
* Boulders Penguin Colony - expensive but worth it.
* Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden - great place to explore fynbos plants.
* Hout Bay Beach, especially at sunset.
* Architecture of Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art (I've not been inside) and surrounding buildings, and the whole V & A Waterfront area.

Food and drink:
* Hemelhuijs - my best meal in South Africa. They only do brunch, and they are really good at it.
* Indian food: Curry Club on New Church street, Awara Restaurant and Shamani Indian Cuisine (in Woodstock).
* Ethiopian food: Ethiopian Madam Taitou, owned by a wonderful owner Solomon. He also has a second location - Timbuktu Cafe, which I haven't visited.
* Art of Duplicity - best cocktails in town, in a Prohibition-Era cocktail club. [Booking](https://170120.co.za/) required. Yes, it's not on Google maps. Look around Truth Coffee Roasting.
* The Gin Bar - they make great negronis too.
* Good hangout spots are Yours Truly on Kloof Street (drinks and pizza) and The Neighbourgoods Market inside The Old Biscuit Mill (in Woodstock, weekends only).
* In Sea Point my favourites were: JARRYDS Espresso Bar + Eatery, Bentleys Bread, Scheckter's RAW, Vagabond Kitchens and Moro Gelato.

Tip: I've tried to rent a car in Cape Town twice (more than a month apart and from different companies), both times I paid online but there was no car when I arrived to pick it up. If it's mission critical, rent from the airport. If not, see if you are more lucky than me.


## Tips:

* Load shedding notifier - install this app on your phone to know when to expect electricity blackouts.
* I've used both MTN and Vodacom sim cards. MTN seems to have better coverage across the country. Both are hard to top-up; beware of deals that offer you loads of data but that can only be used at night. 
* Capitec bank ATMs charge 50 rand per withdrawal.
* Best grocery stores: Woolworth and Checkers. In particular, I ate a lot of macadamia nut butter.
* Even if it is not on the menu, every place has rooibos tea - in case you need a drink free of alcohol, caffeine and sugar. If you do need caffeine, but get a blank stare after ordering a black tea, ask for Five Roses (most popular local brand).
* In Johannesburg the best areas to stay are Parkhurst, Greenside and Parkview. Brenthurst Gardens is still on my to-visit list, booking is required to visit.

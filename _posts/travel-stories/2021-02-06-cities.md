title: World's biggest cities
meta_description: 
teaser: I am a big city addict. I feel truly alive when I am in a big city. My goal is to visit all the world's biggest cities, including cities that are relatively small but are the biggest in their country. Below is the list of 200 cities I've picked for myself. The population data is mainly based on 2020 data from <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities" target="_blank">World City Populations</a>, it is only correct to the order of magnitude. Progress on my goal? 46 out of 200.

  title: Riga, Latvia
  dates: 0.5 million

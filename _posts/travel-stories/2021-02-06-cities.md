title: World's biggest cities
meta_description: 
teaser: I am a big city addict. I feel truly alive when I am in a big city. My goal is to visit all the world's biggest cities, including cities that are relatively small but are the biggest in their country. Below is the list of 200 cities I've picked for myself. The population data is mainly based on 2020 data from <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities" target="_blank">World City Populations</a>, it is only correct to the order of magnitude. Progress on my goal? 42 out of 200.

  title: Riga, Latvia
  dates: 0.5 million
  text: I spent the first 18 years of my life in Riga. The city center is beautiful, though increasingly geared towards tourists. It is enjoyable to explore Riga for several days, as long as you don't speak both Latvian and Russian.

  title: Skopje, North Macedonia
  dates: 0.5 million
  text: The historic city centre, very different from the rest of the city, and the big fortress overlooking it, that stands completely abandoned, are my most vivid memories. I believe there is much more to explore.

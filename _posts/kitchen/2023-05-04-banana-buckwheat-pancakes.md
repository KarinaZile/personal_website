<nbsp></nbsp>
* 2 very ripe bananas
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 200g milk

**Methods:**

* Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, ground seeds, baking powder, cinnamon and salt).
* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Add bananas to the flour mixture, mix until combined. Add milk and vanilla extract, and mix until combined.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a hot non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides are brown.

**Ingredients:**

* Kabocha squash or any other tasty squash/pumpkin
* Cauliflower
* Red onions
* Pre-boiled chickpeas
* Olive oil
* Berbere spice mix
* Salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 400g can of coconut cream
* 0.25 teaspoon turmeric
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 200g millet
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 12g ginger
* 15g herbs (parsley, mint, etc.)
* 1-2 limes
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* fresh spinach
* cucumber
* coconut chips

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Slice the squash, chop cauliflower into large florets, cut the onions into halves or quarters depending on their size.
* In a shallow bowl mix olive oil, berbere spice and salt. Prepare baking sheets covered with baking paper.
* Coat all veggies in spiced oil and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheets. Clean the oily bowl with chickpeas and add them to the baking sheet.
* Bake in the oven until everything is tender and starting to turn dark brown, about 30min. 
* Open the coconut can and separate the creamy bit from the watery bit - 120g of creamy stuff goes into a bowl, the remaining 280g goes into a large pot. 
* To the large pot with coconut add 375g water, turmeric and salt. Bring it to a simmer.
* Add millet to the simmering pot. Bring to a gentle boil, cover with a lid, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 15min. Then, without lifting the lid, turn off the heat and leave it for another 10min. 
* Meanwhile make the sauce: to the bowl with coconut cream add roughly chopped cucumber, ginger and herbs. Add zest of the lime and all of its juice. Add salt. Handblender everything together. If the sauce is too thick, add cucumber and handblender it in. If the sauce is too watery, add xanthan gum or refrigirate it to solidify the fatty part of coconut cream.
* Toast coconut chips in a dry pan.
* Roughly chop the spinach. Thinly slice the cucumber.
* Serve millet, topped with veggies, spinach and sauce, and sprinkled with coconut chips.

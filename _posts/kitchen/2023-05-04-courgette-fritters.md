**Ingredients:**

* 3 courgettes (about 600g)
* 1 small onion
* 70g fresh herbs (parsley, dill, mint)
* flour
* 2 teaspoons coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 100g feta cheese
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* yoghurt
* garlic
* black pepper
<nbsp></nbsp>
* baby potatoes

**Methods:**

* Start boiling baby potatoes.
* Grate the courgettes and place them in a bowl.
* Finely chop the onion and herbs.
* Place a new large bowl onto a kitchen scale. Transfer grated courgettes into a new bowl by hand, squeezing juice out of each handful. You must have a dry looking pile of courgettes in the new bowl. Note how many grams of dry courgettes you have.
* Add 10% of flour by weight (10g of flour for every 100g of courgettes). 
* Add chopped onion, herbs, coriander, chilli powder and salt to the courgettes. Mix well. Crumble in the feta and mix it in gently.
* Pre-heat a non-stick pan with olive oil.
* Use a wooden spoon to scoop the courgette mixture into the frying pan, flattening a little once in the pan. Flip them once they look golden brown on the bottom. The fritters will be tasty, no matter how they look. Transfer to a plate covered with a paper towel to drain any excess oil.
* While frying the fritters, put some yogurt into a small bowl. Use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the yoghurt. Season with freshly ground black pepper.
* Serve fritters with boiled baby potatoes and a yoghurt dip.

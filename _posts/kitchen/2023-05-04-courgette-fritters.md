**Ingredients:**

* about 600g courgettes (2 or 3 of them)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 small onion
* 70g fresh herbs (dill, parsley, mint)
* 60g flour
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon chilli powder
* 75g feta cheese
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* baby potatoes
* yoghurt
* garlic
* black pepper

**Methods:**

* Start boiling baby potatoes.
* Grate the courgettes, use your hands to mix them with salt. Leave to drain in a colander.
* Meanwhile finely chop the onion and herbs. Chop feta into chunks.
* Transfer courgettes from the colander into a big bowl by hand, squeezing juice out of each handful. You must have a dry looking pile of courgettes in the bowl.
* Add chopped onion, herbs, flour, coriander and chilli powder to the courgettes. Mix well. Carefully fold in the cheese.
* Pre-heat a non-stick pan with olive oil.
* Use a wooden spoon to scoop the courgette mixture into the frying pan, flattening a little once in the pan. Flip them once they look lightly brown on the bottom. The fritters will be tasty, no matter how they look. Transfer to a plate covered with a paper towel to drain any excess oil.
* While frying the fritters, put some yogurt into a small bowl. Use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the yoghurt. Season with freshly ground black pepper.
* Serve fritters with boiled baby potatoes and a yoghurt dip.

**Notes:** update the recipe to measure flour based on dry courgette weight.

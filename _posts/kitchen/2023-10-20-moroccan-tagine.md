**Methods:**

* Make a tagine paste - handblender onion, garlic, ginger, spice mix and salt.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat up some olive oil, add the tajine paste you've made. Let it cook for a couple of minutes. Add tomato paste, stir frequently until it turns rust colour. Add harissa. Handblender the contents of a tomato can, if it is not already in chunks/pulp, and add that in. Finely chop preserved lemons and add them.
* Cut beetroots into small chunks, sweet potatoes into medium chunks and cauliflower into bigger chunks (to sinchronise their cooking times). 
* Taste the contents of the pot - adjust salt and spice levels, add more preserved lemons for acidity if needed. Once you are happy, add the vegetables.
* Add water, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer.
* Add in pre-cooked chickpeas. Finely chop apricots and add them in.
* Blanch almonds, remove their skins and add them in.
* Make couscous - cover with the boiling water with lemon juice and zest. OR toasted in (groudnut) oil first, then cooked with water infused with rosemary. 
* Serve tagine with couscous, sprinkled with finely chopped parsley.

**Ingredients:**

* 1-2 onions (about 150g)
* 5 garlic cloves (about 30g)
* a small piece of ginger (about 40g)
* 3 teaspoons Ras El Hanout spice mix
* 1 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* olive oil
* 3 teaspoons tomato paste
* 3 teaspoons Rose Harissa
* 400g can of tomatoes
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1-2 sweet potatoes
* 3-5 beetroots
* 1 cauliflower
* 150g almonds
* 100g dried apricots
* 3 preserved lemons
* pre-cooked chickpeas (about 200g)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* couscous
* parsley

**Methods:**

* Make a tagine paste - handblender roughly chopped onions, garlic, ginger, spice mix and salt.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat up some olive oil, add the tagine paste. Let it cook for a couple of minutes. Add tomato paste, stir frequently until it turns rust colour. Add harissa. Handblender the contents of a tomato can, if it is not already in chunks/pulp, and add that in. Refill the can with water and add that in too.
* Chop beetroots and sweet potatoes into small chunks, and add them in. Chop cauliflower into bigger chunks (to synchronize their cooking times) and add them in. Cover the pot with the lid, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer.
* Blanch the almonds: boil the kettle and submerge almonds in boiling water.
* Finely chop apricots and preserved lemons. Add them in together with chickpeas.
* Remove the skins from the almonds, add them in.
* Taste the contents of the pot - adjust salt, spice (harissa) and acidity (preserved lemons) levels. Add more water if needed.
* Make couscous - mix equal amounts of couscous and boiling water, with a pinch of salt.
* Finely chop some parsley. Taste the contents of the pot for final adjustment.
* Serve tagine with couscous, sprinkled with parsley.

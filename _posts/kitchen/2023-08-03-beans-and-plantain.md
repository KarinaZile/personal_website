**Ingredients:**

* 1 plantain
* olive oil
* 1 lime
* any pre-cooked beans
<nbsp></nbsp>
* tomatoes
* 1 red onion
* a piece of ginger
* red chillies

**Methods:**

* Heat olive oil in a pan. Cut plantain into coins. Fry them on both sides until golden.
* Meanwhile, very roughly chop tomatoes, onions, ginger and chillies. Handblender them into a sauce.
* In a pot combine the sauce with beans (frozen or from a can) and let it cook for a bit.
* Place fried plantain onto a paper towel to remove excess oil. In a bowl combine plantain with a juice of one lime and mix well.
* Serve plantain with beans in a fresh spicy sauce. The ginger and onion still taste raw - that's the idea.

**Ingredients:**

* 280g flour
* 60g oats
* 3/4 teaspoons baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 130g dark bitter chocolate (vegan, 70% +)
* about 480g of very ripe peeled bananas (3-5 bananas)
* 70g sunflower/canola oil
* 170g sugar

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 190C. Line the muffin tin with paper liners.
* Combine flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
* Chop the chocolate into small cubes.
* Mash bananas with a fork (if they are too hard to do this easily, they won't make good muffins).
* Add sugar and oil, beat it well with a whisk.
* Add flour mix, mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate.
* Spoon into the muffin tin, making each cup about 3/4 full.
* Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the muffin tin for a couple of minutes, then remove them to cool completely without becoming soggy.

**Note:** For a vegan recipe use vegan chocolate, or substitute chocolate with a mix of dried cranberries and blanched almonds.

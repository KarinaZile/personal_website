**Ingredients:**

* 200g sugar
* 70g butter
* 140g double cream
* a pinch of smoked salt 

**Methods:**

* Prepare the correct amount of cream. Prepare the correct amount of butter cut into chunks.
* Heat the sugar in a pot over medium high heat until it dissolves and starts to brown. 
* Once it starts to brown, lower the heat and swirl the pot occasionally to facilitate even browning. 
* Once it starts to foam, use the spoon to see what colour is your caramel under the foam. 
* Once it is the colour of black tea, take it off the heat. Immediately add the butter and whisk. Add the cream and whisk.
* Stir in the salt. If you get any lumps, place it back over low heat until everything melts again. 
* Let it cool completely. Then taste and adjust the salt. Keep in a jar in the fridge.

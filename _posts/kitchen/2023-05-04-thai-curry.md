**Ingredients:**

* 30g ginger 
* 30g lemongrass
* 30g shallots
* 30g garlic
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoons salt
* 2 limes
<nbsp></nbsp>
**Make it green:**
* 30g green bell pepper 
* 30g sweet basil (+20g for serving)
* 2 teaspoons ground white pepper
* some green chillies<br/>
**or make it red:**
* 60g red bell pepper 
* 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
* some red chillies
* 20g thai basil (+5g for serving)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* coconut oil
* 2 cans of coconut milk (800g total)
* cashews
* 40g jaggery/muscovado sugar
* 30g vegan fish sauce
<nbsp></nbsp>
* various mushrooms
* green beans
* butternut squash
* potatoes
* cauliflower
* mangetout (sugar snaps)
* cherry tomatoes
* tofu
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Very roughly chop ginger (no need to peel it), lemongrass, shallots, garlic, bell pepper, chillies (and basil if itâ€™s a green curry). Place all of that into a bowl.
* To the bowl, add all the dry ground spices (cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt and white/black pepper) and zest of 2 limes. Hand blender this into paste.
* In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good. Don't let it stick to the bottom of the pot.
* Add cans of coconut milk, and cook for a couple of minutes. 
* Meanwhile, toast cashews in a clean frying pan.
* Add jaggery/muscovado sugar and vegan fish sauce to the curry. Give it a moment, then taste to adjust salt and spiciness levels.
* Start cutting the veggies (mushrooms, green beans, squash, potatoes, cauliflower, mangetout or whatever you have) in the order from hardest to softest. Add them into the curry in that order.
* Cube the tofu and add it in. Add the cashews. Halve the cherry tomatoes and add them in. (If it's a red curry, chop the thai basil and add it in.)
* Close the lid to let the veggies soften. Once the potatoes are no longer crunchy, but still retain a lot of resistance to bite, and the cauliflower is cooked but still crunchy, take the pot off the heat.
* Serve with rice, a generous squeeze of lime juice and topped with basil.

**Notes:** try adding a jar of galangal to the curry paste, try adding lime leaves into the curry, try skipping fish sauce.

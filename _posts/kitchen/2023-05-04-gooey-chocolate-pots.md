**Ingredients:**

* 115g butter
* 170g dark bitter chocolate (70% +)
* 3 eggs (2 whole and 1 yolk)
* 115g sugar
* 35g flour
* 30g cacao powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* raspberries
* plain ice cream

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Melt the butter.
* Cut the chocolate into small pieces. Now that the butter is not too hot, add in the chocolate and gently stir until fully melted but not yet separating.
* Whisk the 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk. Add sugar and keep whisking. Add flour, cocoa powder and salt. Mix well.
* Grease 4 ramekins.
* Once the chocolate mixture is not too hot (not to cook the eggs), stir it in until just combined. Do not overmix!
* Spoon the mixture into the ramekins.
* Bake for 12min, until solid on top but gooey inside.
* Serve with fresh raspberries and plain ice cream.

**Notes:** 
* These gooey chocolate pots are amazing when reheated in the oven from frozen - after a short time the outside gets warm while the middle still retains an ice cream consistency.
* To make white chocolate pots, use white chocolate and swap cacao powder for flour.

**Methods:**
* Shred the carrots with a Julienne peeler.
* Finely chop the onion.
* Heat the oil in a small pan. When hot, add onions and cook them on high heat until they turn golden.
* Prepare the spice mix - coriander, paprika, chilli, salt, sugar and freshly cracked black pepper.
* Use the garlic press to add garlic directly into the pan.
* Once you can smell the garlic, add the spice mix and stir. Take off the heat.
* Pour the hot contents of the pan over carrots. Add the vinegar. Mix with a spoon. Once the carrots have cooled down the oil, use your hands to give them a good massage. 
* Transfer into a closed container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

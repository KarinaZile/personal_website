### Ingredients:

* Aubergines (about 500g)
* Pineapple
* Garlic
* Coconut milk (400ml can)
* Red thai curry paste
* Soy sauce
* Peanut butter (crunchy one)
* Limes
* Fresh basil


### Methods:

* Cut the aubergines into bite size pieces.
* Heat the pan with a bit of vegetable oil. Start frying the aubergines.
* Start boiling the rice.
* Finely chop the garlic and add to the aubergines when they are a couple of minutes away from ready.
* Add a couple of spoons of the thick cream from the coconut milk can and red thai curry paste. Once the paste "blooms" and red oil rises to the surface, add the rest of the coconut milk from the can.
* Add peanut butter and soy sauce.
* Chop the pineapple into bite size pieces and mix it in. Simmer until all the flavours are well combined.
* Add lime zest and freshly squeezed lime juice. A good Thai curry is a balance of hot, sour, sweet and salty. Add more say sauce, lime juice or spice until the flavour is perfect.

**Serving suggestions:** with rice, topped with a squeeze of lime juice and a lot of freshly chopped basil.

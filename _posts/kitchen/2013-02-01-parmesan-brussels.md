**Methods:**

* Cover the bottom of a large cold pan with a thin layer of olive oil. Arrange brussels sprout halves on the pan in a single layer, cut side down.
* Fry on high heat until they brown. Then turn off the heat and cover them with a lid to tenderise them with steam.
* While they are cooking, toast almond flakes in a small pan. Grate some Parmesan. Zest a lemon.
* Place brussels sprouts in a large bowl together with all the oil from the pan. Add a juice of the whole lemon and a generous splash of balsamic vinegar.
* Add milled seeds, toasted almond flakes, grated Parmesan and lemon zest. Mix everything together.

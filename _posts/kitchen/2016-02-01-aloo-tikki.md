**Ingredients:**

* 500g baby potatoes
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 40g tamarind paste
* 0.25 teaspoon clove powder
* 0.25 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 30g pitted dates
* 5g ginger
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 90g yoghurt
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 pomegranate (60g of pomegranate seeds)
* 15g red onion
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 150g green peas (frozen or fresh)
* 0.5 teaspoon coriander powder
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 20g herbs (parsley and mint)
* 1 garlic clove (about 5g)
* 1 green chilli
<nbsp></nbsp>
* sunflower oil (or other neutral oil)
* 100g cooked chickpeas
* 0.5 tablespoon garam masala
* 0.5 tablespoon green mango powder (or lime powder)

**Methods:**
* Start boiling the potatoes.
* Meanwhile, make the tamarind chutney - in a bowl place tamarind paste, clove and chilli powder, roughly chopped dates and ginger. Add 40g water. Handblender everything into a chutney.
* Make the yoghurt chutney - in a bowl place yoghurt and salt. Add 40g water and whisk it into a chutney.
* Slice the pomegranate in half and extract the seeds by making strategic shallow incisions with a sharp knife. 
* Finely chop some red onion.
* Toast cumin seeds in a small clean frying pan. 
* Once the potatoes are tender, drain them over a bowl of green peas (if frozen). Put the pot with the potatoes back on the hot stove top to dry them. Once dry, spread them on a plate to cool off.
* Meanwhile, prepare the peas - in a bowl place now defrosted green peas, toasted cumin seeds, coriander powder and salt, roughly chopped herbs, garlic and green chili. Handblender everything into a chutney.
* Preheat a large frying pan, coat it with a generous amount of sunflower oil. Place the potatoes onto a chopping board and use a flat bottomed object (like a glass) to [crush them into pancakes of uniform thickness](https://youtu.be/aPPRhlYwKYU?t=603). Fry them on both sides until golden brown.
* Meanwhile, preheat the small frying pan with some oil. Add in chickpeas, garam masala and mango/lime powder. Mix everything together and fry until crispy.
* Once potatoes are golden brown on both sides, assemble the dish - place potatoes into individual plates, top with peas, tamarind chutney, yoghurt chutney, chickpeas, some pomegranate seeds (about 60g total) and red onion. There are too many flavours - that's the idea!

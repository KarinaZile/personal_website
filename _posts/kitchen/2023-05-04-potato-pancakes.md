**Ingredients:**

* about 3 big potatoes
* 1 small onion
* flour
* black pepper
<nbsp></nbsp>
* yoghurt
* feta
* fresh herbs (dill, parsley, mint)
* garlic

**Methods:**

* Grate all the potatoes. 
* Place a new empty bowl onto a kitchen scale. Transfer grated potatoes into a new bowl by hand, squeezing juice out of each handful. You must have a dry looking pile of potatoes in the new bowl. Note how many grams of dry potatoes you have.
* Finely chop an onion and add to the potatoes. (Onions prevent potatoes from browning, so try to do this quickly.)
* Add 4% of flour by weight (4g of flour for every 100g of potatoes). Season with freshly ground black pepper. Mix by hand.
* Pre-heat a non-stick pan with olive oil.
* Scatter some potato mixture over the pan and use a wooden spoon to flatten it into one big pancake. Flip it once it looks lightly brown on the bottom.
* While frying the pancakes, put some yogurt into a small bowl. Use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the yoghurt. Crumble in some feta. Finely chop the herbs and them in.
* Serve the pancakes with yoghurt dip.

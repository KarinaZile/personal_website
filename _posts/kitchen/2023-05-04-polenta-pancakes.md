**Ingredients:**

* 70g polenta
* 65g flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon sugar
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 20g butter
* 1 eggs
* 160g buttermilk/kefir
* 70g corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* onions
* red wine vinegar
* mozzarella
* avocados
* limes
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* tomatoes
* mint
* olive oil

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Finely slice the onions and put them into a bowl with red wine vinegar to macerate.
* Mix all the dry ingredients (polenta, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and sugar).
* Separately whisk together the buttermilk/kefir, egg and melted butter. 
* Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until combined. Stir in corn kernels. Do not overmix.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a hot non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides are brown, while the top is still liquid.
* Meanwhile, shred the mozzarella. 
* Make the guacamole: smash the avocadoes, add freshly squeezed lime juice and white pepper powder.
* Make the tomato salad: chop tomatoes and mint, add macerated onions, dress the salad with a vinaigrette of olive oil, lime juice and a bit of red wine vinegar used for preparing the onions.
* Serve pancakes with guacamole, tomato salad and shredded mozzarella.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 red onion (about 80g)
* 3 garlic cloves (about 10g)
* a small piece of ginger (about 20g)
* green chillies
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 0.25 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 0.25 teaspoon turmeric powder
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 750g spinach
* coconut oil
* 1 tomato (about 300g)
* 450g paneer
* 50g double cream
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Prepare a pot of salted boiling water and a bowl of ice water. Blanch the spinach in boiling water and immediately transfer it into the ice water (to preserve its vibrant colour).
* Very roughly chop onions, chillies, garlic and ginger. No need to peel the ginger.
* Place them into a bowl and add all the dry spices (garam masala, chilli, salt, cumin, turmeric). Hand blender this into paste.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good. Add about 100g of water to prevent things from burning.
* Finely chop the tomato and add it in. Let it simmer on low heat.
* Heat a non-stick pan with coconut oil. Cube the paneer and fry it until golden on most sides.
* Meanwhile, drain and handblender the spinach.
* Once the paneer is ready, add spinach and paneer to the pot. Wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Add cream and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Taste and adjust salt and spice levels.
* Serve with rice.

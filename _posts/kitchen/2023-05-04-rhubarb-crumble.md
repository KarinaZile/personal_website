**Ingredients:**

* 400g rhubarb
* 75g sugar
* 3 tablespoons of port-style wine
* 75g flour
* 75g oats
* 50g sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 100g cold butter
* almond flakes
<nbsp></nbsp>
* plain ice cream

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Roughly peel the rhubarb with a knife, no need to be too thorough. 
* Chop the rhubarb into large bite-size pieces, mix with sugar and port directly in the baking dish.
* In a bowl, mix flour, oats, sugar and salt. Drop in cubes of cold butter. Mix them in with your hands.
* Shape the butter and flour mixture into clumps of random size and shape and scatter on top of the rhubarb.
* Bake for 15 min, then scatter almond flakes on top and continue baking for another 15 min (until the rhubarb is tender and the top is crisp and golden).
* Serve immediately, with a scoop of plain ice cream.

**Notes:** Works equally well with peaches or plums.

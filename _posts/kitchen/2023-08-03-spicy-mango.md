**Ingredients:**

* ripe mangos (one half per person)
* limes (if needed)
* Kashmiri chilli powder


**Methods:**

* Cut mango halves off the pit. Use the flesh around the pit to try your mangos. If they are too sweet, you'll need limes.
* For each mango half, make lengthwise and crosswise cuts in the flesh, careful not to cut through the peel. Invert the mango half, so the cut segments stick out like a hedgehog. 
* If they are too sweet, juice limes over the mango halves.
* Sprinkle mango halves with chilli powder and serve immediately.

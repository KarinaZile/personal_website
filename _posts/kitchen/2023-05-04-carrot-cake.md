**Ingredients:**

* 260g carrots
* 4 oranges
* 100g walnuts
* 230g dark Muscovado sugar (+70g later)
* 230g flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 3 eggs
* 145g vegetable oil
* 280g full-fat cream cheese

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease an 23cm loose-bottomed round cake tin.
* Grate the carrots, grate zest from 2 oranges, chop the walnuts. Put these and 230g of muscovado sugar into a large bowl.
* In a different bowl mix flour, baking powder and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves).
* Lightly beat the eggs, combine with oil.
* Add flour mix to the carrot mix and stir until well combined. Add the egg mixture and stir until well combined.  
* Pour into the cake tin and bake in the oven for 35-60 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
* Meanwhile, make candied orange peels. Peel 2 oranges with a vegetable peeler. Cut the peels into thin stripes. In a small saucepan, combine the peels with the juice of these 2 oranges and 70g of muscovado sugar. Simmer until caramelised.
* When the cake is ready, wait for it to cool completely. 
* Make the icing: hand blender cream cheese with the orange syrup from the caramelised orange peels.
* Spread the icing over the top of the cake, decorate with caramelised orange peels.

**Notes:** If you are in a rush, decorate the cake with candied orange peels as it comes out of the oven and serve the icing on the side.

Note: My childhood memory of a fruit salad is pieces of apple and banana served with whipped cream. I hated it. I've tried fruit salads with things like watermelon and oranges  - soggy mess. Until recently my policy was - if you have fruits and berries, eat them. Luckily, I've discovered the magic of 9 or more different fruits and berries (firm ones, that don't make too much juice when cut) consumed in one salad - dopamine avalanche!

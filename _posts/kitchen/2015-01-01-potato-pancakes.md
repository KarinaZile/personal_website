**Ingredients:**

* 2 big potatoes
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 1 small onion
* flour
* black pepper
<nbsp></nbsp>
* yoghurt
* garlic
* fresh herbs (dill, parsley, mint)
* feta

**Methods:**

* Grate the potatoes and place them in a bowl. Add salt, mix it in with your hands and set it aside.
* Finely chop the onion. 
* Place a new large bowl onto a kitchen scale. Transfer grated potatoes into a new bowl by hand, squeezing juice out of each handful. You must have a dry looking pile of potatoes in the new bowl. Note how many grams of dry potatoes you have.
* Add 4% of flour by weight (4g of flour for every 100g of potatoes). Add onion and black pepper. Mix it with your hands..
* Heat olive oil in a large non-stick pan. 
* Scatter the potato mixture over the pan and use a flipper to flatten it into one big pancake. Flip it once it looks lightly brown on the bottom.
* While frying the pancake, put yoghurt into a small bowl. Very roughly chop garlic and herbs, add them to the youghurt and handblender it into a smooth sauce. Crumble in the feta. 
* Serve the pancakes with yoghurt dip.

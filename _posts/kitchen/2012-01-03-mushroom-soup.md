**Ingredients:**

* olive oil
* 1 white onion
* 30g butter + more for frying
* 30g flour
* 240g brandy
* 30g various dried mushroom
* 0.25 teaspoon salt + more for frying
* black pepper
* 500g various fresh mushrooms 
* 5 garlic cloves
* 200g cream 
<nbsp></nbsp>
* fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, tarragon)
* white sourdough bread

**Methods:**

* Finely dice the onions.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of olive oil. Saute onions over medium heat until soft and starting to brown, about 10min. 
* Add in butter and flour, stir and let it brown a bit. Deglaze with brandy. 
* Add 1 liter of water - first add a bit and stir to avoid any lumps, then add the rest. Add in dried mushrooms, salt and black pepper. Simmer under a lid for at least 30min. 
* Thinly slice large fresh mushrooms, cut small ones in halves.
* Heat a mixture of olive oil and butter in a pan; add fresh mushrooms, a bit of salt and a lot of black pepper.
* Once the mushrooms are golden brown on all sides, use the garlic press to add garlic directly into the pan. Saute until it smells really good. Deglaze with brandy. 
* Take the soup off the heat and handblender it until smooth. 
* Back in the pot mix the soup with fried mushrooms. Add cream and gently simmer to let the flavours combine.
* Serve topped with herbs, with bread.

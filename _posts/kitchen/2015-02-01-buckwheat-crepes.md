**Ingredients:**

* 100g buckwheat flour
* 0.25 teaspoon of salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 1 egg
* 330g milk
<nbsp></nbsp>
* asparagus
* red bell pepper
* red onion
* creamy soft cheese (e.g. Saint-FÃ©licien)
* balsamic vinegar

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix buckwheat flour, salt, egg and 100g of milk.
* Add the remaining 230g of milk and melted butter. Mix until well combined.
* Pour batter on a hot non-stick pan covering the whole pan to make thin crepes. Remix the batter before each pour, as butter tends to separate.
* While frying the crepes, blanch asparagus and thinly cut bell pepper and onion.
* Once all the crepes are ready, put one of them on the pan, add cheese and allow it to melt a tiny bit. Transfer to a plate, top with asparagus, bell pepper and onion. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.

**Notes:** They are equally good as a [dessert](/kitchen/buckwheat-crepes-sweet/).

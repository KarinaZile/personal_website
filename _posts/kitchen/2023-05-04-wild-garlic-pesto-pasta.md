* 50g pine nuts
* 150g wild garlic leaves

<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 ball of mozzarella/burrata per person

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the pasta in a pot of salty water.
* Toast pine nuts in a clean frying pan.
* Roughly chop the wild garlic leaves. Grate parmesan, zest the lemon, and add it all in. Add olive oil and toasted pine nuts. Add a splash of lemon juice. Hand blender the pesto. Taste to adjust acidity with more lemon juice.
* Once the pasta is ready, drain it over a mug (to reserve some pasta water) and mix it with the pesto. Add a bit of pasta water if needed to reach a pesto-like consistency.
* Serve topped with a ball of mozzarella/burrata.

**Ingredients:**

<nbsp></nbsp>
* 50g pine nuts
* 150g wild garlic leaves
* 60g Parmesan-style cheese
* 60g olive oil
* 1 lemon
<nbsp></nbsp>
* mozzarella/burrata

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the pasta in a pot of salty water.
* Toast pine nuts in a small clean frying pan.
* Roughly chop the wild garlic leaves. Grate the Parmesan. Zest the lemon.
* In a bowl, combine wild garlic leaves, Parmesan, lemon zest, olive oil and toasted pine nuts. Add a splash of lemon juice. Hand blender the pesto. Taste to adjust acidity with more lemon juice.
* Once the pasta is ready, drain it over a mug (to reserve some pasta water) and mix it with the pesto. Add a bit of pasta water if needed to reach a pesto-like consistency.
* Serve topped with a chunk of mozzarella or a ball of burrata.

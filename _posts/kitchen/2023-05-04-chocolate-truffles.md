**Ingredients:**

* 300g double cream
* 50g butter
* 300g dark chocolate
* 30g cacao powder
* 80g rum

**Methods:**

* Cut chocolate into small pieces.
* Gently heat the cream and butter cut into pieces until butter melts completely (that means the cream is hot enough to melt chocolate too).
* Remove from the heat, add all chocolate and cacao powder into the cream, gently mix, let it sit and melt for a moment. Add rum and mix gently until all chocolate has melted. 
* If the emulsion has split, hand blender it back together until it looks luxuriously glossy.
* Refrigerate the mixture until cold.
* Use a spoon and your hands to make small balls of chocolate mixture, arrange them on a plate.
* Refrigerate the plate with the truffles until cold.
* Put a bit of cacao powder in a jar, add several truffles, close the lid and shake to coat the truffles. Proceed until all the truffles are coated. 
* Store them in the fridge and enjoy.

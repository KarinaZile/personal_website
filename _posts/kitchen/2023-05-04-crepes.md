**Ingredients:**

* 130g flour
* 1.5 teaspoons sugar
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 1 egg
* 360g milk
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
<nbsp></nbsp>
* frozen raspberries
* very dark chocolate

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix flour, sugar, salt, egg and 100g of milk.
* Add the remaining 260g of milk, melted butter and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. 
* Pour batter on a hot non-stick pan covering the whole pan to make thin crepes. Remix the batter before each pour, as butter tends to separate.
* Meanwhile defrost the raspberries in a microwave and finely chop the chocolate.
* Once all the crepes are ready, put one of them on the pan, add some chocolate and allow it to melt a tiny bit. Transfer to a plate, top with raspberry sauce and roll it up.

**Notes:** Another heavenly option is to serve these crepes with dark muscovado sugar and freshly squeezed lemon juice.

**Ingredients:**

* 130g flour
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 1 egg
* 360g milk
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
<nbsp></nbsp>
* Dark muscovado sugar
* Lemon

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix flour, sugar, salt, egg and 100g of milk.
* Add the remaining 260g of milk, melted butter and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. 
* Pour batter on a hot non-stick pan covering the whole pan to make thin crepes. Remix the batter before each pour, as butter tends to separate.

**Serving suggestion:** with dark muscovado sugar and fresh lemon juice squeezed on top. For some reason it is absolutely divine.

**Ingredients:**

* olive oil
* 1 onion
* garlic
* frozen Brussels sprouts (or a fresh piece of cabbage)
* 400g can coconut cream
* 6 teaspoons nutritional yeast flakes
* 1 teaspoon salt
* frozen corn
* potatoes
* some cauliflower
* 1 courgette
* red chillies

**Methods:**

* Heat the olive oil in a large heavy bottom pot. Finely chop an onion and garlic, and saute them.
* Defrost and finely chop some Brussels sprouts, add them in.
* Once the sprouts turn vibrant green, add the coconut cream and about twice as much water. Add yeast flakes, salt and frozen corn.
* Chop potatoes into bite size pieces and add them in. Same for cauliflower and courgette. Finely slice some red chillies and add them in.
* Once potatoes are tender, spoon 25% of the soup into a bowl, seeking out potatoes and chillies, and avoiding courgettes.
* Handblender the contents of the bowl and reunite it with the rest of the soup. Taste and adjust the salt, add a squeeze of lemon if needed.
* Serve topped with black pepper.

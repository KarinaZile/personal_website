**Ingredients:**

* 200g flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 375g buttermilk
* 1 egg

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt).
* Separately whisk together the buttermilk, egg and melted butter. 
* Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until combined. Do not overmix, there should be lumps in the batter.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a hot non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides are brown, while the top is still liquid.

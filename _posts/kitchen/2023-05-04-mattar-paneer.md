**Ingredients:**

* 1-2 onions
* 3 garlic cloves
* a small piece of ginger
* 2 tablespoons garam masala
* 1.5 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 0.5 teaspoon ground cloves
<nbsp></nbsp>
* coconut oil
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 can of tomatoes (400g)
* 2 tablespoon jaggery (unrefined sugar)
* 450g paneer
* 300g frozen green peas
* 150g cream
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Very roughly chop onions, garlic and ginger. No need to peel the ginger.
* Place onions, garlic and ginger into a bowl and add all the dry ground spices (garam masala, chilli, black pepper, salt, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon and cloves). Hand blender this into paste.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good. Don't let it stick to the bottom of the pot.
* Add tomato paste and jaggery and fry for another couple of minutes.
* Hand blender the contents of the tomato can and add that to the pot. Wash the can with a bit of water and add that to the pot. Cook for about 20min.
* Heat a non-stick pan with coconut oil. Cube the paneer and fry it until golden on most sides.
* Taste the curry base and adjust salt and spiciness levels.
* Once the tomato and onion flavours taste cooked, add paneer and frozen peas and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Add cream and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Serve with rice.

**Ingredients:**

* coconut oil
* 450g paneer
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1-2 onions
* 3 garlic cloves
* a small piece of ginger
* 2 tablespoons garam masala
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 cans of tomatoes (800g total)
* 1 tablespoon jaggery/muscovado sugar
* 250g frozen green peas
* 150g cream
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Heat a non-stick pan with ghee. Cube the paneer and fry it until golden on most sides.
* Meanwhile, very roughly chop onions, garlic and ginger (no need to peel it). Place all of that to a bowl.
* To the bowl, add onions, garlic, ginger and all the dry ground spices (garam masala, black pepper, salt, cumin, chilli, turmeric, cinnamon and cloves). Hand blender this into paste.
* In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good. Don't let it stick to the bottom of the pot.
* Add tomato paste and fry for another couple of minutes.
* Hand blender the contents of tomato cans and add that to the pot. Wash the cans with a bit of water and add that to the pot.
* Add jaggery/muscovado sugar and paneer.
* After about 20 min, taste to adjust salt and spiciness levels.
* Once tomato and onion flavours taste cooked, add frozen peas and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Add cream and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Serve with rice.

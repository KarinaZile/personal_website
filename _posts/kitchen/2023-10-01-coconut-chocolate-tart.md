**Ingredients:**

* 120g flour
* 50g almond flour
* 100g sugar
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 110g coconut oil at fridge temperature
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 400g coconut cream
* 180g dark 70%+ chocolate 
* cacao nibs

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed round cake tin with coconut oil.
* In a bowl, mix flour, almond flour, sugar and salt. Add small chunks of cold coconut oil (in solid state). 
* Wash your hands with cold water to make them as cold as possible. Mix the coconut oil into the flour mixture by hand, working fast as the heat of your hands is the enemy. Any remaining chunks of coconut oil will melt in the oven leaving a hole in the crust, so you need to be fast but thorough.
* Keep a glass with straight edges handy.
* Spread about half of the crust mix on the bottom of the cake tin, press it down with your knuckle. Spread the remaining crust mix around the sides of the cake tin and use your knuckle to press it into the sides. Use a glass to smooth everything out into a neat crust.
* Bake at 180C until the crust browns, about 20min.
* Meanwhile, cleanup the kitchen.
* Once the crust is ready and cooling down, start making the filling. Empty the 400g can of coconut cream into a microwaveable container. Chop the chocolate roughly and add it in. Microwave on half-power for 2min, then stir it. If you stir well, it will melt smooth at a surprisingly low temperature. Microwave a bit more if necessary to melt all the chocolate chunks. 
* Once the crust is cool, pour in the filling.
* Put it in the fridge. After about 15min in the fridge, take it out and decorate with a sprinkling of cacao nibs. Put it back into the fridge overnight.

**Ingredients:**

* 150g frozen peas
* 50g fresh spinach
* 4g mint leaves
* 1 garlic clove
* 60g olive oil
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 lemon
<nbsp></nbsp>
* courgette
* 160g frozen broad beans
* asparagus
* 200g pasta
* Parmesan-style cheese


**Methods:**

* Preheat a non-stick pan with a bit of olive oil. Slice the courgettes into circles and arrange them on the pan in a single layer. Fry them until they are browned on both sides.
* Meanwhile, prepare a pot of salted boiling water and a bowl of ice water.
* Chop the asparagus into bite-size pieces. Blanch the asparagus in boiling water for 2-4 minutes and immediately transfer it into the ice water (to preserve its vibrant colour).
* Once the asparagus is done and out, drop the broad beans into the boiling water. Boil them for 2-4 minutes until nice and tender.
* Put the frozen peas into a large bowl and drain the broad beans over this bowl. 
* Start boiling the pasta in a pot of salty water.
* Meanwhile, zest the lemon. Grate some parmesan.
* Make the pesto: Drain the now defrosted peas. Roughly chop the spinach, mint and garlic, and add them to the peas. Add olive oil, salt and pepper. Add the juice of half a lemon.
* Hand blender the pesto. Taste to adjust acidity with more lemon juice.
* Once the pasta is ready, drain it and add it to the pesto. Mix well. Add courgettes, broad beans and asparagus; and mix again.
* Serve topped with lemon zest and parmesan.

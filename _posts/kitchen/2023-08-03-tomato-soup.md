**Ingredients:**

* 1kg tomatoes (cherry or other good ones)
* olive oil
* 4-8 shallots
* 4 garlic cloves
* black pepper
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon dark Muscovado sugar
* 240g dry white wine
<nbsp></nbsp>
* fresh herbs (thyme, oregano, marjoram, basil)
* white sourdough bread


**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 190C.
* Place tomatoes onto a baking tray - leave small ones whole and cut the bigger ones to match the size. Coat them in olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 30min.
* Clean up the kitchen for 15min.
* Finely dice shallots and garlic. 
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of olive oil. Saute shallots and garlic over medium heat until translucent, about 10min. Add black pepper, salt and sugar, and caramelise slightly. Deglaze with white wine.
* Add the contents of the baking tray (tomatoes and all the juices) and bring to the boil. Let it simmer under a lid for 20min.
* Meanwhile finely chop fresh herbs.
* Handblender the soup until silky smooth.
* Serve topped with herbs and a splash of olive oil, with bread.

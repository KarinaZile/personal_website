### Ingredients:

* 90g butter
* 30g sugar
* 60g honey, molasses, maple syrup or any other syrup
* 300g oats
* cinnamon
* salt
* 150g nuts
* 100g seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, etc.)
* 150g dried fruits
* everything else (milled flax or chia seeds, superfoods powders, etc.)

### Methods:

* Preheat the oven to 150C. 
* Heat the butter, sugar, other sweetener, cinnamon and salt until melted and well combined. 
* Add oats and mix until every flake is coated.
* Spread the oats in a uniform layer across the baking tray covered in baking paper. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden but not yet blackening around the edges.
* Put a tray of nuts in the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until smelling lovely and starting to change color.
* In the meantime chop the dried fruits.
* Put a tray of seeds in the oven and bake for 5 minutes or until smelling lovely.
* Take the oats off the baking tray with the baking paper and let them cool down while still looking like a flapjack.
* Once everything is cooled down, chop the nuts and break up the oats into small clumps of crunchy goodness. 
* Mix oats with nuts, seeds, dried fruits and everything else.

**Note:** My favourite combination is almonds, cherries and cacao nibs. Apricots fit well into any combination. Avoid dried fruits that contain sweetners.

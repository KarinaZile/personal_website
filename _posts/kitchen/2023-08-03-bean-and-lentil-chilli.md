**Ingredients:**

* olive oil
* 100g onions
* 100g of peppers (bell peppers, poblanos, whatever you have)
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 30g of dried ancho chillies
* 20g garlic
* 20g tomato paste
* 3 teaspoons Kashmiri chili powder
* 3 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 3 teaspoons cumin powder
* 3 teaspoons cocoa powder
* 600g tomatoes
* 400g can of tomatoes
* 100g red lentils
* 100g corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
* 200g mix of pre-cooked black beans and red kidney beans 
* 3 teaspoons tamari soy sauce
<nbsp></nbsp>
* rice
* parsley
* cheddar cheese
* yoghurt

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Dice the onions.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of olive oil. Saute the onions over medium heat.
* Chop the peppers and add them in. Add salt. 
* While they are sauteing, chop the fresh tomatoes. Handblender the contents of the tomato can, if it is not already in the pulp format.
* Roughly chop the dried ancho chillies and add them into the pot. Use the garlic press to add garlic directly into the pot. Stir.
* Once you can smell the garlic, add tomato paste and dry spices (Kashmiri chili, smoked paprika, cumin, cocoa) and mix everything well.
* Add chopped fresh tomatoes and a can of tomatoes. Refill the can with the bean cooking liquid (or water) twice and add it in.
* Add red lentils, mix everything. Bring to a boil and lower the heat. 
* While the lentils are cooking, pre-heated a large clean pan. Char fresh or frozen corn until it develops dark brown spots and starts popping.
* After about 15min, add in beans (freshly cooked, frozen or from a can) and charred corn. Add more water/bean cooking liquid if needed.
* Let it simmer for another 10min. Check that lentils are done. 
* Add tamari soy sauce. Stir, taste, and adjust salt, acidity, spice and sweetness levels by adding tamari soy sauce, vinegar, chilli powder and brown sugar respectively.
* Serve topped with parsley, grated cheddar cheese and/or yoghurt, with rice on the side.

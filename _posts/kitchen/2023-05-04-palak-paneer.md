**Ingredients:**

* ghee
* 450g paneer
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1-2 onions
* some green chillies
* a small piece of ginger
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 tomato
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (and a bit more)
* 750g spinach
* 2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/4 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 50g single cream
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Heat a non-stick pan with ghee. Cube the paneer. Fry it with a bit of salt.
* Meanwhile, finely chop onions, green chillies, ginger and tomato.
* Once the paneer is golden on most sides, set it aside.
* To the same, now empty, pan add more ghee and cumin seeds. 
* Once the cumin seeds start to splutter, add onions and green chillies, and saute until turning golden but not yet brown.
* Add finely chopped ginger, and use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the pan. Saute until it smells really good.
* Add finely chopped tomato and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute until tomatoes change colour and turn mushy. 
* Meanwhile, prepare a pot of salted boiling water and a bowl of ice water. Blanch the spinach in boiling water and immediately transfer it into the ice water (to preserve its vibrant colour).
* Add dry spices (garam masala, chilli powder, ground turmeric) to the frying pan and mix them in well. Saute until it smells really good.
* Add a splash of water to bring out the flavour of the spices. 
* Hand blender the contents of the pan until smooth, and transfer to a saucepan on low heat. 
* Hand blender the spinach until smooth, and add it to the saucepan.
* Add paneer and let all the flavours combine. 
* Add cream. Wait for the temperature to come back up, then taste to adjust salt and spiciness levels.
* Serve with rice.

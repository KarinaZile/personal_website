A perfect mix of energy, architecture, science, art and entrepreneurship; a mix of big city vibes, historic villages and expansive green spaces. Great idea density. Many things to see and do for free. I believe London is the best place in the world.

### 1. Events

* [Open House Festival](https://open-city.org.uk/open-house-festival) in **September** - celebration of London’s housing, architecture and neighbourhoods. Best stuff requires booking and it gets very competitive; sign up for their newsletter to find out when the bookings open. It is a fun weekend, even if you have no bookings. For example, Allies & Morrison studio (architect office) is a great place to visit, no booking required.
* [London Gallery Weekend](https://londongalleryweekend.art/) in **May/June** - a weekend when private art galleries open to the public, a great opportunity to visit many galleries with no expectation of buying anything. My favourites include Maddox Gallery, Gagosian (Grosvenor Hill), Waddington Custot, Thaddaeus Ropac, Gazelli Art House, Galerie Max Hetzler, White Cube Mason's Yard and Bowman Sculpture. This weekend is also a great opportunity to visit Christie's London (King Street) and Sotheby's London (New Bond Street).
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in **late April/early May** to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/london) in **mid-late May**.
* [Events in Canary Wharf](https://canarywharf.com/whats-on/) - Winter Lights in January, Summer Lights in August, etc.
* If you are in London on Saturday morning, join in for one of the many [ParkRuns](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/events/events/#geo=9.26/51.4634/-0.1734).

* Check [Secret London](https://secretldn.com/) and [Londonist](https://londonist.com/things-to-do) for lists of events on a specific week.

### [2. London neighbourhoods](/travel/london-parts/) 
I very roughly divided London into [24 parts](/travel/london-parts/) and listed my favourite things to do, see and eat in each of them.

### 3. Museums, exhibitions and art (mostly free)

* [Sir John Soane's Museum](https://www.soane.org/) -  the house of one of the greatest English architects, kept as it was at the time of his death in 1837. It displays his collection of antiquities, furniture, sculptures, architectural models and paintings. It is full of curiosities and surprises.
* [Grant Museum of Zoology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/grant-museum-zoology) - a small space densely packed with skeletons.

### 4. Other stuff (free)

See guides by [Caroline and Neil](https://www.cktravels.com/shoreditch-street-art-london-guide-map/), [Rose](https://www.wheregoesrose.com/shoreditch-street-art/), [Inspiring City](https://inspiringcity.com/2020/07/23/a-street-art-map-of-shoreditch-and-brick-lane/) and [Wayfaring Views](https://wayfaringviews.com/see-shoreditch-street-art-get-your-london-with-edge/).

* Architeccture in Westminster. Parliament Square Garden from which Big Ben, Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey can be observed. Westminster Cathedral - an architectural gem that should be much more famous.
* [National Theatre Archive](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/about-the-national-theatre/archive) - here you can watch recordings of all London theater productions that are no longer showing on stage, for free. Booking required for specific time and a specific production you want to see.

### 5. Gardens and parks
* [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on) - one of the best botanical gardens in the world. Arrive at the opening time, as one day is not enough to see everything. Don't miss [Marianne North Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nALt1P7UtU), Shirley Sherwood Gallery, [Agius Evolution Garden](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/11-things-about-evolution-garden), Alpine House (especially in April-May), [the giant waterlily](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/new-giant-waterlily-victoria-boliviana-discovered-at-kew) in the Waterlily House.
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in late April/early May to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* Regent's Canal. From Angel station it goes East to Victoria Park. From there you can continue North to Olympic Park or South to Limehouse. From Olympic Park you can continue North along the River Lee or South to Royal Observatory Greenwich (crossing under the Thames via Greenwich Foot Tunnel). In the opposite direction, from King's Cross, Regent's Canal goes West past Wembley, and you can follow it all the way to Slough or Kew Bridge. Both directions (East from Angel and West from King's Cross) are excellent for running and all-day walks.
* Huge Hampstead Heath park, extending into Highgate Wood in the North and Golders Hill Park in the West.
* Regent's Park. Don't miss Queen Mary's Rose Gardens.

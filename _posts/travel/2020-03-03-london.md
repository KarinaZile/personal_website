### 6. Cuisines of the world (most places require booking ahead)

**Chinese:**
* Tofu Vegan - best vegan Chinese restaurant in London. They've now opened several locations.

**Ethiopian:**
* Laza Eritrean Ethiopian Restaurant - daily homemade injera, wonderful owner.

**European:**
* Silo London - zero-waste restaurant with a great tasting menu. They mill their own flour and make their own butter. They aim to eliminate food waste, so expect ice cream made from leftover sourdough bread.

**Indian (North):**
* Dishoom King's Cross. I'm not sure why there is so much hype about this restaurant chain, but this specific location is truly special - a warehouse where goods and spices arrived from Bombay in the 1930s.

**Indian (South):**
* Chettinad Restaurant - not amazing, but I've not yet found a better place.

**Italian:**
* Zia Lucia - great pizzas, including their famous charcoal crust.

**Middle-Eastern:**
* Bubala Spitalfields - one of the tastiest tasting menus. I left feeling that I should have paid more given how much I loved it.
* Berber & Q Grill House - amazing restaurant run by a great team.
* Berber & Q Shawarma Bar - same people as Berber & Q Grill House.

**Nigerian:**
Chuku's (Nigerian Tapas) - loads of vegan options.

**Persian:**
Persepolis - vegetarian restaurant in Peckham.

### 7. Cocktails (most places require booking ahead)

* Lounge Bohemia in Shoreditch.
* The Last Tuesday Society in London Fields.
* Looking Glass Cocktail Club in Shoreditch.
* Nightjar in Shoreditch.
* Little Bat in Angel.

### 8. Pastries

* PARISSI in Brixton.

### 9. Just outside London

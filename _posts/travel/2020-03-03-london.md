A perfect mix of energy, architecture, science, art and entrepreneurship; a mix of big city vibes, historic villages and expansive green spaces. Great idea density. Many things to see and do for free. I believe London is the best place in the world.

### 1. Events

* [Open House Festival](https://open-city.org.uk/open-house-festival) in **September** - celebration of London’s housing, architecture and neighbourhoods. Best stuff requires booking and it gets very competitive; sign up for their newsletter to find out when the bookings open. It is a fun weekend, even if you have no bookings. For example, Allies & Morrison studio (architect office) is a great place to visit, no booking required.
* [London Gallery Weekend](https://londongalleryweekend.art/) in **May/June** - a weekend when private art galleries open to the public, a great opportunity to visit many galleries with no expectation of buying anything. My favourites include Maddox Gallery, Gagosian (Grosvenor Hill), Waddington Custot, Thaddaeus Ropac, Gazelli Art House, Galerie Max Hetzler, White Cube Mason's Yard and Bowman Sculpture. This weekend is also a great opportunity to visit Christie's London (King Street) and Sotheby's London (New Bond Street).
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in **late April/early May** to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/london) in **mid-late May**.
* [Events in Canary Wharf](https://canarywharf.com/whats-on/) - Winter Lights in January, Summer Lights in August, etc.
<nbsp></nbsp>
* Check [Secret London](https://secretldn.com/) and [Londonist](https://londonist.com/things-to-do) for lists of events on a specific week.

### [2. London neighbourhoods](/travel/london-parts/) 
I very roughly divided London into [22 parts](/travel/london-parts/) and listed my favourite things to do, see and eat in each of them.

### 3. Museums, exhibitions and art (mostly free)

* [Sir John Soane's Museum](https://www.soane.org/) -  the house of one of the greatest English architects, kept as it was at the time of his death in 1837. It displays his collection of antiquities, furniture, sculptures, architectural models and paintings. It is full of curiosities and surprises.
* [Grant Museum of Zoology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/grant-museum-zoology) - a small space densely packed with skeletons.
* [The British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions-events) and their [Lates](https://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/late-opening-on-fridays).

### 4. Other stuff (free)
* Street art around Shoreditch. See guides by [Caroline and Neil](https://www.cktravels.com/shoreditch-street-art-london-guide-map/), [Rose](https://www.wheregoesrose.com/shoreditch-street-art/), [Inspiring City](https://inspiringcity.com/2020/07/23/a-street-art-map-of-shoreditch-and-brick-lane/) and [Wayfaring Views](https://wayfaringviews.com/see-shoreditch-street-art-get-your-london-with-edge/). Look out for works by [Dan Kitchener](https://www.dankitchener.com/).
* Indian temples (especially worth seeing if you've not yet been to India): BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London (marble and wood) and Shri Sanatan Hindu Mandir (limestone) in Wembley; London Sri Mahalakshmi Temple (South Indian) in East Ham.
* [National Theatre Archive](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/about-the-national-theatre/archive) - here you can watch recordings of all London theater productions that are no longer showing on stage, for free. Booking required for specific time and a specific production you want to see.

### 5. Gardens and parks
* [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on) - one of the best botanical gardens in the world. Arrive at the opening time, as one day is not enough to see everything. Don't miss [Marianne North Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nALt1P7UtU), Shirley Sherwood Gallery, [Agius Evolution Garden](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/11-things-about-evolution-garden), Alpine House (especially in April-May), [the giant waterlily](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/new-giant-waterlily-victoria-boliviana-discovered-at-kew) in the Waterlily House.
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in late April/early May to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* Regent's Canal. From Angel station it goes East to Victoria Park. From there you can continue North to Olympic Park or South to Limehouse. From Olympic Park you can continue North along the River Lee or South to Royal Observatory Greenwich (crossing under the Thames via Greenwich Foot Tunnel). In the opposite direction, from King's Cross, Regent's Canal goes West past Wembley, and you can follow it all the way to Slough or Kew Bridge. Both directions (East from Angel and West from King's Cross) are excellent for running and all-day walks.
* Huge Hampstead Heath park, extending into Highgate Wood in the North and Golders Hill Park in the West.
* Regent's Park. Don't miss Queen Mary's Rose Gardens.
* Primrose Hill - a perfect spot for a picnic and/or sunset watching.

**African:**

* Merkato in King's Cross. Loads of vegan options.
* Andu Ethiopian in Dalston. Loads of vegan options.

**European:**
* Silo London - zero-waste restaurant with a great tasting menu. They mill their own flour and make their own butter. They aim to eliminate food waste, so expect ice cream made from leftover sourdough bread.
* EDIT in Hackney.
* NOPI - by Ottolenghi.
* Ottolenghi (Islington) - by Ottolenghi.
* Tendril - a naughty vegan restaurant (with a bit of cheese). Both tasting menu and à la carte.

**Indian:**
* Kricket Soho - contemporary North Indian.
* Dishoom King's Cross. I'm not sure why there is so much hype about this North Indian restaurant chain, but this specific location is truly special - a warehouse where goods and spices arrived from Bombay in the 1930s.
* Cafe Tiffin - North Indian in Angel.
* Chettinad Restaurant - South Indian food. Not amazing, but I've not yet found a better place.

**Italian:**
* Zia Lucia - great pizzas, including their famous charcoal crust. Several locations.

**Latin American:**
* [supperclub.tube](https://supperclub.tube/) - Latin American inspired tasting menu. A unique experience of dining on a 1967 Victoria Line tube carriage.
* Mestizo - awesome Mexican grocery shop near King's Cross. Their restaurant next door has an authentic menu (in writing), but the food lacks flavour and quality.

**Middle-Eastern:**
* Bubala Spitalfields - one of the tastiest tasting menus. I left feeling that I should have paid more given how much I loved it.
* Berber & Q Grill House - amazing restaurant run by a great team.
* Berber & Q Shawarma Bar - same people as Berber & Q Grill House.

**Persian:**
* Persepolis - vegetarian restaurant in Peckham. The Feast menu is packed with flavours.

## Reasons to go:

### <a name="atacama"></a> 1. Atacama Desert

The easiest way to explore the Atacama Desert is to fly into Calama airport (CJC) and drive or take a pre-booked transfer to San Pedro de Atacama. The best thing in San Pedro de Atacama itself is the [Meteorite Museum](https://www.museodelmeteorito.cl/). It has very limited opening hours, check in advance and make sure you don't miss it.

I think it would be best to explore the Atacama Desert independently, from San Pedro de Atacama in a rented 4x4 car, but I failed to do that. Here is a list of tours I took, numbered from most to least memorable:  
**6. Rainbow Valley / Valle del Arcoíris** (-22.640978, -68.241002) - rock formations in many different colours.  
**4. Laguna Cejar** - the tour stops at Laguna Piedra (-23.059217, -68.213681) where you can swim in increadibly salty water, Laguna Tebenquiche (-23.136368, -68.256889) and Laguna Chaxa (-23.288791, -68.176847). Expect to see flamingoes. There are 3 types (Flamenco Andino, Flamenco Chileno and Flamenco de James), try learn how to distinguish them (I failed at that).  
**1. Tatio Geysers / Geysers Del Tatio** - car parks at (-22.33218, -68.013257) and (-22.338409, -68.016755). The tour also stops at viewpoints for wetlands (-22.532907, -68.042465) and flamingoes (-22.612212, -68.058974).  
**5. Moon Valley / Valle de la Luna** - the tour takes you past the entrance (-22.914209, -68.319886) and to many photo-opportunity spots. I wish I could explore on my own instead. Don't miss Mina Victoria (-22.932527, -68.310032) - an old mine which now makes a lot of cracking sounds as rocks heat up and cool down (you have to be really quiet for a minute). Do the hike that gets you to the top of the big dune. You must book the tickets on puntoticket.com in advancce.  
**3. Lagunas y Piedras Rojas** - the tour stops at Laguna Miscanti (-23.738427, -67.790195) and Piedras Rojas (-23.921324, -67.696401). Increadible landscapes.  
**2. Astronomy tour** - see the southern hemisphere sky through powerful amateur telescopes.  

**Notes:**
* The best food I could find in San Pedro de Atacama was in Franchuteria (breakfast), Jardin Meraki (lunch/dinner) and Bubalu (ice-cream with local flavours, try rica-rica)
* The wet season here is December to February.
* There are no banks in San Pedro de Atacama, so you'll need cash for everything (including expensive tours). The ATMs charge 5-10 USD per withdrawal and there are low limits on withdrawal amounts, so arrive with loads of cash if possible.
* San Pedro de Atacama is a starting point for amazing 3 day tours into [Bolivian salt flats](/travel/bolivia/#salt) (one-way to Uyuni or return).

Many bars have a licence that only allows them to sell alcohol with food, so sometimes going for a drink after dinner is tricky.

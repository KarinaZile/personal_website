## Reasons to go:

<a name="berlin"></a>
### 1. Berlin

##### 1.1 Architecture and museums
* [Schwerbelastungskörper](https://www.schwerbelastungskoerper.de/visitor-services.html) (The Heavy Body) - a heavy load-bearing body made of solid concrete. It was erected in 1941 to test the load-bearing capability of this area.
* [Flakturm Humboldthain](https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/verein/projekte/flakturm-humboldthain.html) - the remains of a Second World War anti-aircraft gun blockhouse tower. I've heard of guided tours that can take you inside.
* Bierpinsel - a fun building.

Still on my to-visit list: 
* Jewish museum (both the building itself and the museum inside)
* KÖNIG Galerie
* Stasi Museum (Stasi spying equipment housed in imposing, original HQ of the secret police)
* Design Panoptikum (surreal museum of industrial objects) 
* [silent green Kulturquartier](https://www.silent-green.net/en/) (events, art and café in what used to be Berlin's first crematorium) 
* Spandau Citadel (old part of Berlin)
* Classic-Remise Berlin (vintage cars)
* [Buchstabenmuseum](https://www.buchstabenmuseum.de/en/visit/) (collection of abandoned typographic signs)
* [Monsterkabinett](https://www.monsterkabinett.de/index-en.html)
* [DDR Watch Tower](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ddr-watch-tower)
* [House of One](https://house-of-one.org/en) (a house of worship that brings a synagogue, a church, and a mosque together under one roof)
* tours by [Subterranean Berlin](https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/en/index.html)
* city views from the TV Tower
* and all the museums on the Museum Island

##### 1.2 Street art
* Teufelsberg - an 80 metre hill created from 75 million cubic meters of post-Second World War rubble. It covers an unfinished Nazi military-technical college. During the Cold War, it was a US listening station. Now it is a [street art gallery](https://www.teufelsberg-berlin.de/). Area is well double-fenced, double check the opening times before heading there. Entrance is not free.
* Artpark Tegel - 8 huge murals on 4 buildings; starting from (52.576079, 13.272607) and east from there. Nearby BaliBowls offers ok food.
* East Side Gallery - outdoor street art gallery stretching from Park an der Spree (near Berlin Ostbahnhof) to Oberbaumbrücke (Oberbaum Bridge).
* Still on my to-visit list: Urban Nation, following [Giulia's guide](https://www.blocal-travel.com/street-art-guide/street-art-berlin-maps/), Urban Spree (not open on Saturdays?), Haus Schwarzenberg.

##### 1.3 Food and drink
* [Velvet](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velvet-bar) - the world's most exciting cocktail bar!
* Kopps - excellent vegan tasting menu. I've not yet tried their cocktail bar.
* [Tadshikische Teestube](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-tearoom) - Tajikistan tearoom.
* Bamboo Leaf - Vietnamese restaurant. Great mango curry. Don't miss Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (1890s church damaged in the war) while you are in the area.
* Hallesches Haus - nice food in a wonderful setting.
* Saravanaa Bhavan Berlin - authentic South Indian food.
* Bellboy Bar Berlin - a pretentious cocktail bar inside a Hilton Hotel building. They cherish their dress code. [Marian Beke](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2734/people/marian-beke) joined their team in 2023, so cocktails will likely improve. You must visit their bathroom - it is an experience, especially during busy times. 
* Still on my to-try list: FREA (zero-waste vegan restaurant), Fairytale Bar, CODA Dessert Dining, Alaska Bar, Markthalle Neun (indoor market).

##### 1.4 Parks and gardens
* Tempelhofer Feld - former airport-turned-public park. Next time I'm planning to shop at Markthalle Neun and bring a picnic here.
* Mauerpark - on a Sunday morning this is THE place where Berlin people hangout. Nearby is [Café Morgenrot](https://www.cafe-morgenrot.de/en/about-us-english/) - they used to serve an all-you-can-eat brunch to die for, now I wouldn't go there for food...but perhaps for the experience of a cafe where "right-wing behavior is not tolerated".
* Treptower Park - a park with a Soviet war memorial.
* Still on my to-visit list: Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum, Nature Park Schöneberger Südgelände, Tiergarten, Gardens of the World, Spreepark, Britzer Garten.

##### Notes:
* BVG Tickets Berlin - one app for all public transport tickets. A 24-hour ticket might not save you money, but allows you to travel through the city worry-free.
* Always have cash on hand, surprising amount of "they'll definitely take cards" places are proudly cash-only.
* All museums are free on the [first Sunday of every month](https://www.museumssonntag.berlin/en).
* Read about [Mietskaserne Tenements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/the-story-behind-berlin-s-iconic-home-design) before you go, in case you get to stay in one of these buildings.
* Berlin is very vegan.



### 2. Hiking in Nationalpark Sächsische Schweiz

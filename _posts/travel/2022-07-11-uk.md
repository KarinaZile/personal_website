## Reasons to go:

### 1. Cities

#### 1.1 [London](/travel/london/) and [it's neighbourhoods](/travel/london-parts/)

#### 1.2 Edinburgh

#### 1.3 Birmingham

* The Jewellery Quarter - a lovely neighbourhood. Great cocktails at [40 St Pauls](https://www.40stpauls.co.uk/) gin-centered cocktail bar. Still on my to-visit list: Ikigai at 1000 Trades cocktail bar and Damascena Jewellery Quarter for brunch. I can highly recommend the area around St. Paul's Church as the best place to stay during your visit.
* Digbeth (including the Custard Factory) - the neighbourhood full of street art. I used this [map](https://visitbirmingham.com/things-to-see-and-do/graffiti-art-of-digbeth-walk-p1346341) as a rough guide, but keep exploring and you'll find more, for example [The Brolly Works public parking](https://goo.gl/maps/bd1hN4YEQARatiHc9). Look out for works by [Annatomix](https://www.annatomix.com/about) and [Title](https://graffitibytitle.com/gallery/). Still on my to-visit list: Chance & Counters board game cafe.
* Gas Street Basin - an area of canals. Ikon Gallery is great.
* City Centre - I loved the vegan tasting menu at Land, Indian food at Ark Restaurant and cocktails at Fox and Chance. Still on my to-visit list: The Pineapple Club Birmingham cocktail bar.

Nearby:
* Lapworth Museum of Geology - a paradise of rocks and fossils. Fluorescent rocks on the upper floor are magnificent!
* Chakana - an amazing Peruvian/Japanese restaurant with numerous vegan options.
* Lichfield cathedral is beautiful. The rooftop tour is still on my to-do list.
* Moseley Bog - the park that inspired landscapes in The Lord of the Rings, nice for a short walk.
* Still on my to-visit list: Couch Stirchley cocktail bar.



#### 1.4 Bath

* The Roman Baths
* Bath Abbey, decorated with carvings of [angels climbing the ladders](https://curiousrambler.com/the-upside-down-angels-of-bath-abbey/)
* Paxton & Whitfield - great cheese shop
* City's unique architecture, good examples include The Circus and The Royal Crescents
* Still on my to-visit list: Museum of Bath Architecture list

Outside Bath:
* Stonehenge and Avebury (which is still on my to-visit list)
* Lacock village that is a famous filming location for a reason





### 2. Hiking in the Lake District

* Striding Edge - ridge walk to Helvellyn
* Crinkle Crags
* Stickle tarn - a lake in the crator of an ancient volcano, great views and further hiking opportunities from there.
* Hardknott Roman Fort
* Scafell Pike
* Buttermere hike from Buttermere village, up to Red Pike, along the ridge to High Stile, and back along the north-east side of Buttermere lake. Beware of loose small rocks that make some steep parts of the route perilous, regardless if you do this hike in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
* Rydal Cave - a short hike for a rainy day when no serious hiking is possible.

Note: A great way to visit without a car is to take the train to Windermere, stay there and take [buses](https://www.lakedistrictonboard.com/transport/lake-district-buses/) to starting points of different hikes. Usually a [pdf](https://tiscon-maps-stagecoachbus.s3.amazonaws.com/Timetables/Cumbria/Lakes%20Connection/Summer%202022/CNL%20SUMMER%2022%20Lakes%20Guide%20web.pdf) of current bus schedule can be found.


### 3. Other Stuff

* [Museum of the Moon](https://my-moon.org/) by Luke Jerram is great; various temporary locations around the UK. 


## Notes

* Trainline app is the best place to see all UK trains. The app is free to use to track trains in real time, but you pay commision if you buy tickets through the app. It makes my life so much easier, that I'm ok with paying the commision.

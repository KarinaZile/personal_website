## Reasons to go:

### 1. The area around El Peñón, Catamarca Province

The only thing that this otherworldly beautiful place lacks is a marketing manager, and hence it remains largely undiscovered. I explored it on a one-way road trip from Salta to Mendoza. Here is a list of places I visited durinng the trip, listed in chronological order and numbered from most to least memorable:  

**&#x2022;**  Beautiful jungly drive from Salta to El Carmen.  
**7. Multicoloured mountains.**  There are three great viewpoints: Mirador A la cercanía de los 14 Colores del Hornocal (-23.201818, -65.188096), Painter's Palette (-23.617754, -65.410175) which is my favourite, and Mirador panoramico de Purmamarca (-23.745321, -65.496491) also known as Cerro de los Siete Colores (it's a hard to find viewpoint, but put in the effort to be rewarded with amazing views and to avoid paying for worse viewpoints inside the city). When passing through Tilcara, stop for excellent pasta at Bienmesabe restaurant.  
**8. Salt flats.**  Beautiful drive from Purmamarca to Salinas Grandes Jujuy (-23.599456, -65.879239), beautiful salt flats.  
**&#x2022;**  Beautiful drive from Salinas Grandes Jujuy to San Antonio de los Cobres. Viaduct Polvorilla is still on my to-visit list (as it required 4x4 car).  
**&#x2022;**  Beautiful drive from San Antonio de los Cobres to Campo Quijano; and from El Carril to Payogasta via Piedra del Molino peak. A direct drive from San Antonio de los Cobres to Cachi might be even more awesome, but the road was closed at the time I was there.  
**2. Los Cardones National Park (land of big cacti).** Both the road from Payogasta to Recta del Tin Tin (-25.210379, -65.971453) and the road from there to Peña El Colte (-25.260307, -66.213167) are a must, for different reasons.  
**2. Quebrada de las Flechas**  (-25.701002, -66.138513) and a walk to Mirador El Ventisquero (-25.706053, -66.117683) - unbelievable rock formations. The whole drive from Peña El Colte to Cafayate is beautiful.  
**&#x2022;** In Cafayate my best memories are wine tasting at Vinos Stutz (-26.073922, -65.973084), dinner at Árbol Negro Bodega Garage and breakfast at Flor del Valle Bakery. Still on my to-visit list is Piattelli Vineyards where you can taste wines produced in Cafayate and Mendoza (different climates), comparing each grape varietal side by side.  
**5. Garganta del Diablo.** Beautiful drive from Cafayate to Garganta del Diablo includes 3 atractions: Garganta del Diablo (-25.848631, -65.699405) - an amazing rock formation that looks like a throat that you can climb into (the "prohibited" sign at the beginning of the climb only says that it is prohibited to proceed in flip flops); The Amphitheatre (-25.855527, -65.700553) - an amazing rock formation (with no climbing opportunities); a flat walk from (-26.017674, -65.824639) into the beautiful landscape, away from tourists.  
**&#x2022;**  Beautiful drive from Cafayate to El Peñón and beyond to Antofagasta de la Sierra. Stop at Dunas de la Difunta (-26.854675, -66.746706) to climb the dune to recover from a long drive.  
**1. The area around El Peñón**  (see below)  
**9. Sitio Arqueológico "El Shincal de Quimivil"** (-27.689662, -67.183458) - explore an ancient Inca city with an audio guide in English.  
**6. Cable Carril "Chilecito" in Chilecito**  - old mining infrastructure. Cable Rail Station 1 "Chilecito" (-29.18047, -67.491714) is an interesting place to stop, but Station 2 "El Durazno" (-29.133075, -67.565507) is absolutely not to be missed.  
**&#x2022;**  Beautiful drive from Chilecito to Villa Unión.  
**3. Talampaya National Park**  (-29.784501, -67.993367) - I took a tour to Talampaya Canyon and Shimpa Canyon, there might be other good options of what to do in the park. Book in advance. During the wet season (December to February) tours might be cancelled due to roads turning into rivers, during the windy season (May to October) the environment becomes hostile.  
**3. Ischigualasto Provincial Park**  (-30.163861, -67.84326) - awesome landscapes and rock formations, but it is the history of dinasour evolution that makes this place special. Guided tours (during which you drive in your own vehicle) start every hour on the hour. There are also two museums full of dinasour bones, but the museums are operated by the local university's staff and so might be closed on some days when the park is open. Check in advance to avoid disappointment. Not possible to book in advance.  
**4. El Leoncito National Park** - a beautiful 8km hike with amazing mountain views. It is mandatory to register with the park rangers (-31.795962, -69.33363) before starting the hike and after you finish hiking; you can start it any time from 9am until 4pm.  
**4. Astronomical Complex CASLEO**  in El Leoncito National Park (-31.798589, -69.295664) - the best option is to [book a combined overnight visit](https://reservascasleo.com) (Visita Completa, Nocturna y Diurna) that includes nigth sky observation with amateur telescopes, accomodation, breakfast, a tour of the big optical telescope and sun observations with an amateur telescope.  
**&#x2022;**  Beautiful drive from El Leoncito to Mendoza. A detour from Uspallata to old "Desvio las Leñas" train station is a beautiful drive that includes 3 atractions: the old "Desvio las Leñas" train station (-32.821208, -69.983279), a wonderful view of Aconcagua (-32.822848, -69.938499) and Puente del Inca (-32.826622, -69.910895) which is a touristy spot but is still worth stopping. If in need of food, stop for pasta at "La Lore Pasta-Bar" (-32.59354, -69.348703) in Uspallata.  
**&#x2022;**  Mendoza (see below)  
**&#x2022;** The wine region north of Mendoza (see below)  



**The area around El Peñón**  
This is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I'd prefer to explore the area on my own, but you do need a serious 4x4 for that (everyone here drives Toyota Hilux). If you arrive in a less all-terrain car, your options are to take tours starting from El Peñón or Antofagasta de la Sierra. Tours go in 3 general directions:
* Campo de Piedra Pómez - an immense expanse of volcanic rock, an otherworldly landscape characterized by a vast and ancient flow of pumice from the eruption of [Volcán Blanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Blanco_(volcano)). The tour starts by driving around the Volcan Carachi Pampa (-26.481588, -67.342784, -26.434287, -67.481732, -26.452157, -67.508796, -26.498054, -67.507582, -26.590656, -67.504813, -26.588285, -67.482698, -26.585172, -67.456265) and the last stop is at the Campo de Piedra Pómez carpark (-26.592951, -67.44422). When I visited, the new entrance to this protected area was being built at (-26.482455, -67.387587), so I expect soon the route will have to start here.
* Salar de Antofalla - breathtakingly beautiful drive from Antofagasta de la Sierra. The route included (-25.582739, -67.529839), Ojos del Campo (-25.612659, -67.672686), (-25.678318, -67.738291), Vega de La Botijuela (-25.745218, -67.821352) where the owner will want to charge you money for being on his private (breathtakingly beautiful) land, Tinchos Vulcano (-25.959589, -67.744424) and (-26.080055, -67.593028).
* [Volcan Galán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1n) (-25.996724, -66.905238) - one of the largest exposed calderas in the world. The tours enter the caldera by car and take you to the lagoons inside the caldera. I didn't have time to do this tour.

Notes: 
* The wet season here is from December to February. Flamingo season is from September to May.
* A lot of accomodation options are not on Booking.com. This is the case not only in El Peñón and Antofagasta de la Sierra, but in other places between Salta and Mendoza too. Zoom in on the place where you'd like to stay, find accomodation options marked on the map and try to contact them directly via phone or email.



**Mendoza**
* Mendoza is a great place for working from home. The best place to stay is between the Plaza Independencia and the Parque General San Martín. This neighbourhood has many gems: bread and pastries from Brillat Savarin, Anna Bistró loved by locals, amazing ice-cream from Angolo Dolce and Alma de Helado, vegetarian restaurant Caléndula. Avoid touristy area east of Plaza Independencia. 
* Azafran - tasting menu (vegetarian option available, wine pairing optional), one of the most tasty ones I've ever tried. Booking required.
* Drinks at The Garnish Bar and La Central Vermutería are still on my to-try list.
* Outside city center there are great optionns for dinners and lunches in wineries (listed in my order of preference): Casa Vigil El Enemigo (dinners only, tasting menu, wine pairing unavoidable); [Club Tapiz](https://www.club-tapiz.com.ar/) serving food with olive oil, vegetables, dried fruits and wine of their own production; Espacio Trapiche (wine pairing unavoidable). Bookings strictly required.

Notes:
* Both Cabify and Uber apps work in Mendoza.
* Mercado Central is where you find imported goods like coconut milk cans, tofu, and sundried tomato paste. Everyone there knows everyone, ask any shop about what you are looking for and they'll point you to the right shop.



**The wine region north of Mendoza**
* There are 3 wine valleys: Maipú, Lujan de Cuyo and Uco. To make the most of this area, first research which bodegas make the kind of wine you like, then book your visit with them, and finally arrange the transportation (in Maipú and even Lujan de Cuyo it could be a bycicle, in Uco you'll need a driver). If it's a last minute plan, then use an agency that already has everything pre-booked.
* In Maipú Valley I had a good experience with "Wine and Ride". The highlight for me was Las Guapas Bodega where I got to try Malbec rose wine that spent 4 months in skin contact at very low temperature. The result was nothing like Malbec and nothing like rose wine, it tasted brightly of strawberries. 
* In Uco Valley I had a good experience with Ampora Wine Tours. The highlight for me was Bodega Familia Zaina, where they make small batches of interesting wines, mixing oenology with tarot cards.
* Another option, which I haven't tried, is to use "Cabify bodegas" option in Cabify app. A single fee covers transport to and from a winery and a waiting time of up to 8 hours. I imagine it is easy to negotiate with the driver to visit other wineries for an additianal fee ccovering extra work and fuel.



### 2. Southern Patagonian Ice Field

**Hiking from El Chaltén**
* Fitz Roy / Laguna de los Tres hike, [20km+ based on your route choices](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/10492582369). The hike starts from (-49.320254, -72.894909) in El Chaltén, after initial climb it remains mostly flat until (-49.285243, -72.953509), from there you have two options - a steep one and a flat one. The steep option leads to Laguna de los Tres (-49.280957, -72.983987), I didn't do this route but it must be spectacular. The flat option is to explore left and right: view to Fitz Roy (-49.288982, -72.955827), mirador Piedras Blancas (-49.275032, -72.952705) and mirador Glaciar Piedras Blancas (-49.264604, -72.949762); the view of the glacier is spectacular. Where the route splits and you have the choice whether to go via Laguna Capri or not, I recommed to go via mirador Fitz Roy (-49.300284, -72.920191) on your way there and via Laguna Capri (-49.302853, -72.929678) on the way back, then you can relax on the shore of Laguna Capri for the whole of the remaining time until you absolutely have to return to El Chaltén. Do this hike on the best weather day as it includes the best views, but the immediate surroundings are beautiful throughout the whole hike so it is totally worth it even in miserable weather. 
* Laguna Torre hike, [20km+ based on your route choices](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/10484946438). The hike starts from (-49.333993, -72.899766), 





<!-- 

    from El Chalten to Laguna Torre (+stunning views of Cerro Torre) - one of the nicest hikes in Patagonia. 
    Like most hikes in El Chalten, the first thirty minutes are the toughest part as you ascend from town into the mountains. The first highlights are the Margarita waterfall and the Mirador del Torre viewpoints. After that, it’s pretty smooth sailing through the river valley. A lot of this part of the trail goes through the forest so you aren’t overly exposed to the elements or wind.
    Mirador Maestri extension - From the ridge before descending to the lagoon’s shore, you have the option to keep going for 2 kilometers to the Maestri viewpoint. The trail isn’t market but is easy to follow along the ridge circumventing the lagoon below. It’s a little difficult but worth it! You’ll see the glacier full-on from this viewpoint and get a unique view of the Cerro Torre’s granite needles as well.

Chorrillo del Salto waterfall - 500m from a car park

Pliegue Tumbado (21km, 8h)
    Instead of bringing you to the foot of the village’s infamous peaks, it brings you up and around to the best panoramic views.
    The trailhead is the same as Mirador de los Condores, turn to the left for the Condores and to the right for Pliegue Tumbado.
Lago & Glaciar Huemul (4km, 2h)
    37 kilometers from El Chalten down Ruta Provincial 41 in Lago del Desierto.
    The hike has an entry fee (small) as the entire trail is on private property. The trailhead is right by the free parking lot next to the cafe. Pay at the kiosk selling snacks.
    It’s an easy hike through a forest and it’s completely different than anything you’ll see in El Chalten. It’s humid, moss-covered, and gorgeous. The first half of the hike is pretty steady and all of the elevation gain hits you at the end but it’s short. Luckily, there are ropes strung up on the trees to help you pull yourself up. This hike has HUGE rewards for very minimal effort.


in El Chalten
Lunch place, grill and pasta dinners. 



**Perito Moreno Glacier**
While hiking from El Chaltén allows you to see glaciers from afar, at this national park (not free) a glacier can be observed up close and from above. And Perito Moreno Glacier is gorgeously beautiful and very active. Balcon Inferior was my favourite spot for observing it. -->



### 3. Buenos Aires


<!-- ## Neighbourhoods


### Palermo Soho


Gran Dabbang - BEST - a fusion of Middle Eastern, Italian and Indian cuisines that defies rules. The most exciting restaurant in BA. Should be called a tasting menu.

## Day trips 

Tigre - it's crowded and everyone is here to go on a boat trip, so aim to get here early, get on a boat and get out of the mess. Smallest boats are most fun, big boats can only do fun trips during high tide. I did a trip in 9-people boat, with a stop near La Martita restaurant to go for a walk. If you happen to be on "Tren de la Costa" to get to/from Tigre, don't miss the great view of the city. 





## Notes

Best place to stay - Palermo Soho (around Plaza Inmigrantes de Armenia), surrounded by nice neighbourhoods - Palermo Hollywood, Belgrano, Villa Urquiza, Villa Crespo, Recoleta 
Anywhere in Palermo is nice.

"Sube" metro card, can buy 1 for everyone. Works in Mendoza and other big cities.

Don't come in January or for xmas/new years. 

Cabify works, uber not tried.

Arroyo Maldonado https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldonado_Stream - look out for street markings of it -->




### 4. Tierra del Fuego Province

<!-- Ushuaia


Isla Vegana - great vegan sandwiches for hiking, focaccia, alfahores with vegan dulce de leche, and much more. local craft beer
Ana & Juana (two locations) - if you are in need of a cake
La Anónima - well stocked supermarket

In Ushuaia taxis are metered inside the city and fixed price for hiking destinations outside the city. It is usual to pay a return fair and agree on the pickup time for the return journey with the taxi driver. If you are happy to depart and return on the hour, mini-buses are often a very similar and much cheaper option. You'll need a taxi to depart early in the morning or to return after 19:00 (during the summer the sunsets in Ushuaia are very late).



Parque Nacional Tierra del Fuego

In the park there are 4 long trails and an area with loads of short trails, Lapataia. I did the Senda Costera (big trail) first, followed by as many short trails in Lapataia as I had time for. My highlights from the short trails were watching beavers through my binoculars at the end of Senda Castorera (-54.855235, -68.594303; and the devastation these invasive species cause to the ecosystem) and making it all the way to the lighthouse (-54.860785, -68.560515) at the end of Senda de la Baliza. The whole [18km hike](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/10362216498) was very enjoyable and easy (360 meters of elevation gain).

Inside the park there are three drop-off/pick-up points served by mini-buses and taxis. I took a mini-bus from Terminal de Ómnibus de Ushuaia (they depart every hour on the hour) to the first stop (-54.846511, -68.481283; the start of the Senda Costera) and got picked up at the last stop (-54.855153, -68.577928). This way I could spend as much time as I wanted enjoying the Senda Costera (one of the most beautiful trails in this park) and then use the remaining time to do short trails (last pickup at 19:00).

Hiking outside the national park

There are a lot of hiking opportunities around Ushuaia. I only had time for the most popular hike - Laguna Esmeralda, and I loved it. From the beginning of the trail (-54.721852, -68.121948), I hiked to Laguna Esmeralda (-54.69231, -68.12884), around it, and then up to Laguna Turquesa (-54.733154, -68.14296) to get a beautiful view of Laguna Esmeralda from above. This was [17km hike](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/10355318257) with 670 meters of elevation gain. 




Cruises to Antarctica depart from here. There are two options - book in advance (use [this website](https://www.adventure-life.com/antarctica/tours) to brows available cruises with useful filters and [this website](https://www.cruisemapper.com) to find out the age, size, ownership and other details about the vessels you are considering) or hunt for last minute discouted tickets while in Ushuaia. 


choosing antarctica cruise
- 100 passangers only
- stabilisers
- zodiacs
- operator that is part of IAATO
Dramamine




tourists look for WU on Google maps and form long queues at those locations. Instead use https://location.westernunion.com/ar/ to identify locations that don't show up on google maps searcches. For example in Ushuaia, there are very long queues at 12 de Octubre 169, V9410 but nobody knows about the location inside a phone cover shop at Av. San Martín 999, V9410 (they allow withdrawals up to 100,000 ARS, keep this secret and use them quitly).

If you need any gear, guys at Campamento Base shop will sort you out.

## Food and drink in Argentina:

* Both Buenos Aires and Mendoza are worthy of gastronomy tourism. 
* Most wines are made to local taste - they are easy to drink, they taste young and lack body. 
* More than half of Argentinians have some degree of Italian ancestry, and yet most of Italian food in the country is inedibly bad.
* DDL stands for dulce de leche.

## Notes:

* The currency situation in Argentina is fascinating, I'd love to do a PhD on this topic. At the time when I visited, the best way was to send myself money through Western Union and withdraw cash from a local branch; this way I got twice as much ARS for the same amount of currency in my bank account compared to paying by card. The situation is constantly chainging, so do some research before your trip. Note that tourists seem to look for Western Union on Google maps and form long queues at those locations. To avoid queueing, see [the map of all branches](https://location.westernunion.com/ar/), identify locations that don't show up in Google maps searches, and use them quietly.
* Based on the [coverage map](https://www.nperf.com/en/map/AR/) I chose Claro prepaid sim card and it worked well. Buy the sim card in a Claro shop (passport required, cash only), then top up in corner shops as needed (ask for "recarga Claro"). [Here](https://simple.claro.com.ar/inicio/) you can see how much money you have on your account and how much different packages cost.
* Here they are called Islas Malvinas; do not under any circumastances call them Falkland Islands.
* Movies to watch before you go: [Argentina, 1985](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15301048/).

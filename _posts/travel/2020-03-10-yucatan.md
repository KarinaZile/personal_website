<h4>Reasons to go:</h4>

<h5>1. Mayan Civilization</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Zona Arqueológica de Uxmal is fascinating, loads to explore and much less crowded that other more popular places.</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Haciendas</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Hacienda Yaxcopoil is a great place to learn about haciendas, the crops they grew and the machinery they used.</li>
  <li>Hacienda San Pedro Ochil is now a restaurant where you can enjoy good food in a spectacular setting.</li>
</ul>

<h5>4. Other stuff</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Las Coloradas salt flats full of red-coloured algae, plankton and brine shrimp that give the water it's bright pink colour. Flamingos frequent this place.</li>
  <li>Cenotes - natural sinkholes resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater. There are many of them.</li>
  <li>Grutas Calcehtok - exciting caves to visit with a guide.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My favorite places to stay:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Izamal. Pirámide de Itzamatul and Pirámide Kinich Kakmó are right in the middle of the city. Nice architecture and lively atmosphere.</li>
  <li>El Cuyo. Lovely atmosphere of a relaxed coastal village. El Chile Gordo is the best restaurant in the whole of Mexico in my opinion. Naia Cafe is also very good.</li>
</ul>

<a name="kings-cross"></a> 

### 12. King's Cross 

* Known as the [Knowledge Quarter](https://www.knowledgequarter.london/) - The British Library, The British Museum, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute, Francis Crick Institute, UCL, SOAS, Royal College of Physicians, Google, Springer Nature, The Guardian (and many more) are all located here.
* [King's Cross Visitor Centre](https://www.kingscross.co.uk/visitor-centre) is a great place to start. The model of the neighbourhood gives you an overview of what there is to explore.
* Explore Pancras Square, Granary Square, Lewis Cubitt Square, Gasholder Park, Coal Drops Yard, etc.
* Regent's Canal. It goes West past Wembley, and you can follow it all the way to Slough or Kew Bridge. It is excellent for running and all-day walks.

* [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/)

Pastries and sourdough from [Little Bread Pedlar](https://www.lbpedlar.com/) are to die for.
* Mestizo - awesome Mexican grocery shop near King's Cross. Their restaurant next door has an authentic menu (in writing), but the food lacks flavour and quality.
* [The Rooftop at The Standard](https://www.standardhotels.com/london/features/the-rooftop-bar-standard-london) - overpriced drinks are totally worth it on a warm sunny evening, as this bar has a unique view of the beautiful St Pancras Station.
* [Crypt Gallery](http://cryptgallery.org/) - an atmospheric gallery worth visiting, no matter what the exhibition is.

**Food and drink:**
* Dishoom King's Cross. I'm not sure why there is so much hype about this North Indian restaurant chain, but this specific location is truly special - a warehouse where goods and spices arrived from Bombay in the 1930s.
* Merkato - Ethiopian. Loads of vegan options.
* Indian Lounge - not the best food, but super convenient location and no booking required.

* The Barbican Estate - one of the largest examples of Brutalist style architecture. It represents an utopian ideal for inner-city living. Have fun exploring. For example, try to find St Giles Cripplegate.

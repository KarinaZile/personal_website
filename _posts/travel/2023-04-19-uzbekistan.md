## Reasons to go:

### 1. Samarkand
* Registon Square - if you only have time to see one thing, make it this one. Allow a lot of time to explore it during the day, and come back in the evening to see it lit up in the dark. There is a 30 minute light show every evening, during my visit it started at 20:00.
* Shah-i-Zinda was my second most favourite place in Samarkand. A fun way to visit is to first enter the Muslim Cemetery (39.663795, 66.984848), explore it along the main walkway, and then step over the very low locked gate (39.663443, 66.988065) to find yourself in the deep end of Shah-i-Zinda. After visiting, follow Organic Maps to the viewpoint (39.662512, 66.988778) outside the complex.
* Amir Temur Mausoleum Gur-i Amir Сomplex. When inside the mausoleum, turn on your phone torch and press it against the stone walls left of the tomb to see the beatiful colour variations inside the stone slabs.
* Bibi-Khanym Mosque - both renovated and not-yet-renovated parts.
* Hazrat Khizr Mosque and Islam Karimov Mausoleum mean a lot to locals. Be extra respectful of local norms and dresscode, and you'll be rewarded with sights of real not-for-tourists life.
* Observatory of Ulugbek. Visit Ulugbek Memorial Museum first, then the remains of the observatory will make sense. On the way back to city center, stop by to visit Khoja Daniyor Mausoleum - it is believed that the saint continues to grow in the tomb, so the tomb is very long. It mean a lot to locals, so be extra respectful of local norms and dresscode.
* Shishraxtxona Maosoleum - this will give you an idea how Samarkand looked pre-restoration. Across the street is the Khodzha Abdu-Derun Mausoleum and a big new mosque is being built next door to it.
* Siab Bazar. Possible items to hunt for include kurut (dried sour cheese balls), anzur (pickled wild onion, sold only in Samarkand), dried apricots stuffed with walnuts, fried ready-to-eat chickpeas.
* Kosh Hauz Mosque is close to Registon Square and yet receives no attention from toursits. A cute little minaret insite the courtyart makes it totally worth a visit.
* I didn't visit the Samarkand winery (Samarkandskiy Vinnyy Zavod Imeni M. A. Khovrenko), or The Eternal City in the brand new district called Samarkand City (I believe it is just a place for storing tourists overnight).

**Notes:** 
* Read [Oriental Architecture website](https://www.orientalarchitecture.com/cid/229/uzbekistan/samarkand) to learn about architectural gems of Samarkand.
* YandexGo taxi app works well in Samarkand.
* The best area to stay for 1 to 3 nights is between Siab Bazar and Registon Square, that way you'll have half of the places to see north of you and half of them south of you, with many just a short stroll away. For a longer stay, it's best to be just west of the Central Park.
* I had great vegetarian food at The Indian Kitchen (a restaurant opened by students from India who studied medicine in Ukraine and were displaced by the war) and at Xan Atlas Restaurant. If I had more time, I'd try Cafe Punjab (next door to The Indian Kitchen).
* If you've prepared an efficient route through the city, you can see pretty much everything in 2 full days.

### 2. Khiva 

Most of the architectural gems of Khiva are located inside the walls of Ichan Kala. 
While it looks confusing on Google Maps, the walls of Ichan Kala are clearly marked on Organic Maps. 
To visit Khiva's architectural gems, you must buy a ticket (valid for two consecutive days) at the ticket office just outside the West Gate (Ota Gate).

**2.1 Sights covered by the single ticket:**
* Toshhovli palace. Note that there are two separate ticketed entrances that lead to different, not interconnected parts of the palace. Khan's reception room is beautiful.
* Kuhna Ark. The tower of this fortress is the best spot for watching sunset lighting up Khiva's architectural gems. Don't miss the mint, though money printed on silk has been replaced with photocopies. 
* Juma Mosque. The wooden columns inside contain evidence of Khiva’s Zoroastrian past - a bird standing on the shoulder of an hourglass, a peacock, etc. Sadly I forgot to look for them.
* Islam Khodja Madrasa, hosting Museum of Applied Arts.
* Kutlug Murad Inaq Madrassah, hosting a collection of paintings. From the courtyard you can access the underground part.
* Mohammed Rakhim Khan Madrassah.
* and many more.

**2.2 Sight that require extra payment on site:**
* Islam Khodja Minaret - it is very expensive, but totally worth it. Climbing the tallest (or second tallest?) minaret in Uzbekistan is an experience in and of itself. The views of the city from the top of the minaret are breathtaking.
* Walk on top of the walls of Ichan Kala, starting from the North Gate (Bakcha Darvaza) where you buy the tickets. Allow a lot of time for this, and maybe even bring a picnic. 
* Pahlavan Mahmoud Mausoleum. Peeking at the beautiful entrance of the mausoleum was enough for me, so I didn't buy the ticket.
* Nurullaboy Palace. Very different from other things you see in Khiva, because it is a summer palace not motivated by religion, like the Sitorai-Mokhi-Khosa palace in Bukhara. The palace itself is a fun blend of eastern and western styles of decoration. Apart from the palace, there are a lot of interesting galleries to explore, so allow a lot of time for this visit.

**2.3 Free:**
* Kalta Minor Minaret. This minaret was never finished, which leaves it up to your immagination how tall it could have been. When the construction started, the goal was to be able to see Bukhara from the top of this minaret.
* Khiva Silk Carpet Work Shop. Read [A Carpet Ride to Khiva: Seven Years on the Silk Road](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7176581) before you arrive, and observing weavers working with naturally dyed silk will feel like the most interesting thing you've ever seen.
* Things outside the Ichan Kala walls - Said Niyaz Shali Karabay Mosque (real not-for-tourists mosque), Abd Al Bobo complex that is fun to explore, Naspurush Madrassah, Tort Shovvoz Complex, etc.

**Notes:** 
* Read [Oriental Architecture website](https://www.orientalarchitecture.com/cid/216/uzbekistan/khiva) to learn about architectural gems of Khiva.
* It is best to stay inside the walls of Ichan Kala.
* The local specialty is [shivit oshi](https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/shivit-oshi-khiva-noodles) - bright green dill noodles topped with potato and carrot stew (with beef or beef stock) and served with tangy yogurt. Khorzem Art Restaurant is the only place in the city that really knows what you mean by "vegetarian", but shivit oshi and other food there is disappointing. Terrassa Cafe & Restaurant offers great food and amazing views of the city both before and after sunset, and they'll serve you vegetarian shivit oshi if you ask for it...though how vegetarian the stew will actually be depends on who is in the kitchen that day. Cafe Zarafshon offers good food, but there is no vegetarian option for shivit oshi (they'll remove the bits of beef for you, but it is still a beef broth stew) and the place is set up to cater to big tourist groups. If I had more time, I'd try Khiva Moon.
* If you've prepared an efficient route through the city, you can see pretty much everything in 2 full days.
* The local taxi app is Khiva taxi 1054, but I haven't tried it.
* From Khiva it is not far to the Shavat border crossing into [Turkmenistan](/travel/turkmenistan/).

### 3. [Karakalpakstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakalpakstan)

**3.1 A trip to the Aral sea is likely to include:**
* Mizdakhan Necropolis. Don't miss the underground part of the Mazlumkhan Sulyu Mausoleum (42.402689, 59.388248), Mazar of Shamun Nabi (the thomb of the person who was so kind that by now everyone believes he was very tall; 42.401527, 59.388839), Khalifa Yerezhep Madrassah.
* Ship Graveyard in Muynak (43.788711, 59.034174). These ships used to be wild, but now they are all here, which makes it more convenient but less fun. The Museum of Aral Sea History tells the story of the ecological disaster that happened here. Formerly the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral sea is disappearing because the rivers that used to feed into it were diverted for cotton irrigation. Locals told me that another reason for diverting the rivers was the fact that extracting gas deposits located under the Aral sea is much cheaper when it's dry. Do your own reading.
* Viewpoint from the Ustyurt Plateau (44.085611, 58.36458).
* Aral Canyon viewpoint (44.156379, 58.377036).
* A cemetery of nomadic muslims (44.233517, 58.276947).
* Ruins of a Caravan Saray (44.487615, 58.191741).
* All tourists are brought to this point on the shore of the Aral sea (44.505747, 58.233074). There are many ways to drive here on the now dry bottom of the sea. Tour operators prefer to drive on the Ustyurt Plateau instead, as it allows good views of Aral Canyon and Aral sea, and visits to a cemetery of nomadic muslims and ruins of a Caravan Saray. To get here by driving on the Ustyurt Plateau, you must pass the checkpoint (44.498706, 58.186099). There used to be only one option for accomodation - the yurt camp (44.497874, 58.208055). Now the people who profit from collecting tiny shrimps from Aral sea are building a new yurt camp (44.505747, 58.233074), it is not yet known what kind of place it will become.
* Abandoned fishing village Urga (43.58529, 58.540614) on the shores of Lake Karateren (which used to be part of the Aral sea). If you see locals in their boats, try to talk them into taking you for a short boat ride. Don't miss the high viewpoint (43.582772, 58.536274) of the lake.
* I didn't get to visit [Barsa-Kelmes salt flats](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/karakalpakstan/barsa-kelmes.htm) (43.267592, 57.795735) or [Vozrozhdeniya Island](https://adventuresoflilnicki.com/aralsk-7-kantubek-vozrozhdeniya-uzbekistan/).

**3.2 Ancient fortresses**
* Read [Oriental Architecture website](https://www.orientalarchitecture.com/cid/218/uzbekistan/karakalpakstan) to learn about these.
* Ayaz Kala (42.014163, 61.029914) has the best walls to walk on.
* Toprak Kala (41.92787, 60.821588) has the best rooms. A bit of renovation is going on.
* Kizil Kala (41.930053, 60.784158) looks most like a castle. A lot of renovation is going on.
* [Сhilpik Dakhma](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chilpik-tower-of-silence-dakhma) (42.264133, 60.069789) was high on my wishlist, but the road works prevented me from getting anywhere near it.
* Once you are in the area, also visit Sultan Uvays baba meshiti (42.011139, 60.645233) - a huge necropolis of high significance to locals and completely unknown to tourists. Be extra respectful of local norms and dresscode.

**3.3 Nukus, the capital**
* [Nukus Museum of Art](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/uzbekistan/articles/the-savitsky-collection-the-extraordinary-art-of-resistance/) founded by Igor Savitsky is the main attraction. 
* If I had more time, I'd visit Muhammad Imam Iyshan masjidi - the main mosque.
* Premier Lounge has ok vegetarian options and even ok pizzas. If I had more time, I'd try Cinnamon cafe.

### <a name="tashkent"></a> 4. Tashkent
* To explore old Tashkent I followed [this Caravanistan map](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/center/tashkent/walking-old-tashkent/) through Chigatay Graveyard, along the Kolkouz canal, into the Hazrati Imam complex, inside the Chorsu bazaar, and beyond.
* To explore central Tashkent I followed [this Caravanistan map](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/center/tashkent/walk-centre/). Pedestrianised Sailgokh Street is clearly a place to be on a warm summer night.
* Metro stations in Tashkent are beautiful and it is now even allowed to take photos of them. Follow [this guide](https://adventuresoflilnicki.com/tashkent-metro-uzbekistan/) to explore them. Some of the best ones are Mustaqillik Maydoni, Alisher Navoi, Kosmonavtlar. 
* Shayhantaur Memorial Complex is worth a visit. In particular, try sitting on the sofa in Sheikh Hovendi at-Tahur Mausoleum with somebody you know and, when nobody is watching, touch their ear...and see if you get the same weirdest effect that I got.
* Tashkent City Park and buildings surrounding it is the newest neighbourhood of Tashkent. It was interesting to see it and infer the direction in which the city is developping.

**Parkent Solar Furnace**  
Parkent Solar Furnace (41.314656, 69.740569), also known as Physics Of The Sun research institute, is located just outside Tashkent. 
This was the most interesting place I've visited in/around Tashkent. 
If you speak Russian, message Шерматов Жавохир Зафарович, the senior scientist at the institute, via Telegram +998901675582 to arrange a tour (not free). 
If you don't speak Russian, ask a travel agency if they can arrange you a visit in a different language. 
Read more about the institute [here](https://pashbymaul.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/day-34-parkent-solar-furnace/) and [here](https://www.rferl.org/a/uzbekistans-spectacular-soviet-era-solar-furnace-once-used-to-produce-rocket-parts/30466598.html).


I'm so not done with Tashkent; my to-visit list is still long:
* Tashkent Television Tower (passport required to visit)
* Railway Museum
* Mosques (Minor mosque, Rakat Jami Mosque)
* Art galleries (139 Documentary Center, Bonum Factum gallery, House of photography)
* A walk along [Anhor Canal](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/center/tashkent/anhor-canal/)
* Neighbourhoods (Mirabad, Mirzo Ulugbek)
* Markets (Alay Bazaar, Mirabad Bazaar)
* Restaurants (Gril'yazh, Cafe 1991, Khiva Restaurant in Hyatt hotel)

**Food and drink in Tashkent:**
* For breakfast, [Safia](https://safiabakery.uz/ru/locations) chain of bakeries is excellent. In particular, the location at 54 Imam At-Termezy Street is great.
* Afsona restaurant is pricey and it is on the touristy Taras Shevchenko Street, but for vegetarians this is a great place to try traditional Uzbek food.
* Korean restaurants are great for vegan food. I loved this one: 한식당 알파&본죽 (alfa bonjuk ресторан). Next, I'd try this one: 서울식당, Сеул, Restaurant Seoul.
* Other vegetarian-friendly options are Lebaneese (Cafe Forn Lebnen is great) and Georgian (I'd like to try Gruzinskiy Dvorik and Georgia) restaurants.
* The Bar Speak Easy - the only cocktail bar in Uzbekistan.

**Notes:**  
* The best place to stay in Tashkent is close to a metro station. Based on the places where I wanted to eat, Oybek station was most convenient for me.
* YandexGo taxi app works well in Tashkent.
* Read [Oriental Architecture website](https://www.orientalarchitecture.com/cid/221/uzbekistan/tashkent) to learn about architectural gems of Tashkent.
* Look out for works of the local graffiti artist [InkUZart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkuzart).
* Every YandexGo driver recommended me to visit Magic City Park, but I think I did well by avoiding it.

### 6. Still on my to-visit list: 
* [Ferghana Valley](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/ferghana-valley/)
* [Termez and rural South Uzbekistan](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/south/)
* [Nuratau mountains](https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/center/nuratau-mountains/)

<!-- ## Before you go:
* The main cities in Uzbekistan are conveniently connected by train, but this is severely limited by the small number of trains in the country. Once you start planning your trip, [buy all the train tickets you'll need](https://e-ticket.railway.uz/ru/home) as soon as possible. 

There are not many trains in

Buy train tickets 
buy early.  Don't buy spare train tickets
Print train tickets twice. or not

## Notes:

* nobody checked registration slips
camping?

* Ucell pre-paid sim cards work well. Passport required to purchase. Avoid Beeline - a Russian provider of sim cards. If you land in Tashkent airport, start by withdrawing UZS from the airport's ATM, buy Ucell sim card in the airport (cash only), install YandexGo taxi app (for me it was not possible to install it before arriving in Uzbekistan), and you are all set. 
* Every mobile device has to be registered with the government using [this website](www.uzimei.uz). I didn't stay long enough, so I didn't do it.


* Taxi prefer cash



* I got local currency both through ATM withdrawals and by exchanging USD in a bank (Agribank), both with no problems.

* challenge: organic, guides, blogs  and gmap spell everything differently

* Thanks to tourism, vegetarian food is now widely available not only in Tashkent, Samarkand and Bukhara, but also in Khiva and Nukus.
food-dinner. Ramadan - restaurants busy after 7



* NazzAR app - free AR audio guides for many tourist sites


* Many postboxes in Uzbekistan are no longer in use, so bring your postcards to the post office.


* Plugs: Europe

* burner phones

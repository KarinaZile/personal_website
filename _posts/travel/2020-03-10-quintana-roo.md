Compared to horrible Canc√∫n, Tulum is a nice but touristy place to stay.

<h4>Reasons to go:</h4>

<h5>1. Beaches</h5>
<ul>
  <li>From Tulum, drive past Centro de Visitantes Reserva de la Biosfera Sian Ka'an (not free to enter) to end up on an endless beautiful beach with hardly any people.</li>
</ul>

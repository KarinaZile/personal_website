### Ingredients:

* Wholegrain rice
* Onions
* Various mushrooms
* Garlic
* Potatoes 
* Red Thai curry paste
* Green beans
* Cauliflower
* A can of coconut milk
* Muscovado sugar
* Cherry tomatoes
* Thai basil
* Limes

### Methods:

* Start boiling the rice.
* Finely chop the onions and start frying them.
* Chop all the various mushrooms and add them to the pan.
* Chop garlic and add it to the pan.
* Chop potatoes into bite-size pieces and add them to the pan.
* Chop cauliflower into bite-size pieces and chop green beans in half.
* Add red Thai curry paste to the pan, stir well and let the aroma develop.
* Transfer the content of the pan into a pot, add cauliflower, green beans, a can of coconut milk and a spoon of muscovado sugar.
* Half cherry tomatoes and roughly chop Thai basil. Add them to the pot. (If you only have sweet basil, instead sprinkle it on top when serving.)
* Once the potatoes are no longer crunchy, but still retain a lot of resistance to bite, and the cauliflower is cooked but still crunchy, take the pot off the heat.
* Serve with rice and limes to squeeze on top.

**Notes:** In the UK, [Mekhala Red Curry Paste](https://www.planetorganic.com/products/mekhala-red-curry-paste-100g) is the only decent vegetarian option I found so far.

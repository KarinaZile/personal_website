### Ingredients:

* 30g butter
* 200g flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 0.5 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 375g buttermilk
* 1 egg

### Methods:

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt.
* Separately whisk together the buttermilk, egg and melted butter. 
* Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until combined. Do not overmix, there should be lumps in the batter.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides is brown, while the top is still liquid.

**Serving suggestions:** Fruits, berries, yoghurt and cacao nibs. Or citrus fruits and whipped feta. Don't reach out for honey or syrup by default, enjoy the taste of the fresh fruits, bitterness of cacao nibs and creaminess of yoghurt instead.

### Ingredients:

* 2 very ripe bananas
* 130g buckwheat flour
* 5g baking powder
* 5g ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 175g milk


### Methods:

* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Mix flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
* Add flour mixture to the bananas, mix until combined. Add milk and mix until well combined.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides is brown.


**Serving suggestions:** Unhealthy option is to lace pancakes with rum and serve with chocolate ice cream and toasted almond flakes.

### Ingredients:

* 115 g butter
* 170g chocolate 70%+
* 2 eggs,
* 1 egg yolk
* 115g sugar
* 35g flour
* 30g unsweetened cacao powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Methods:

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Cut chocolate into small pieces.
* Melt the butter. When it's not too hot stir in the chocolate and gently stir until fully melted but not yet separating.
* Mix tha eggs and the egg yolk with sugar.
* Add flour, cocoa powder and salt. Mix well.
* When the chocolate mixture is not too hot (not to cook the eggs), stir it in until just combined but not overmixed.
* Grease 4 ramekins and spoon the mixture into them.
* Bake at 200C for 12min, until solid on top but gooey inside.

**Serving suggestions:** with raspberries and plain ice cream.

**Note:** To make white chocolate pots, simply skip the cacao powder. These gooey chocolate pots are amazing when reheated in the oven from frozen - after a short time the outside gets warm while the middle still retains an ice cream consistency.

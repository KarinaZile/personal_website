All recipe websites I've come across have one thing in common - they are made by people who love to cook. 
I don't. 
I want a high return on investment - maximum amount of flavour and nutritional benefit for minimum amount of effort and/or time. 

I made this online collection of my favourite recipes to address 3 of my pain points:
* The daily question of what's for lunch and what's for dinner? 
I don't have time to think about what to cook. 
To make it easy to pick a recipe, I've arranged my recipe collection by nutritional value (nudging me to eat more pulses, nuts, seeds and mushrooms), by veggies/fruits that are in season, and by type - heartwarming curries for cold days, cold salads for hot days, etc.
* If I'm heading home and I'm hungry, I want to shop on the way instead of first consulting my cookbooks at home. 
I copy-paste the ingredient list from here into my shopping list, tick off the items I know I have in my kitchen, and done!
* I optimise recipes for speed and for using less items that I'll need to wash afterwards; I convert all amounts into grams, even for liquids, so I can add everything into a container on the scales, without dirtying any measuring devices. 
I don't want to re-optimise a recipe from another website every time I decide to make it. 

If you find this online collection useful, please [send me one high-return-on-investment recipe](mailto:hello@karina.io) as a token of gratitude!

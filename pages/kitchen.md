All recipe websites I've come across have one thing in common - they are made by people who love to cook. 
I don't. 
I want a high return on investment - maximum amount of flavour and nutritional benefit for minimum amount of effort and/or time. 

I made this online collection of my favourite recipes to address 3 of my pain points: 
* The daily question of what's for lunch and what's for dinner? 
If I have time and energy, I can *be creative in the kitchen*; this collection of recipes is for those times when my brain needs a break. 
*Add some coconut milk* calls for a conscious effort to make a good judgment, which at certain levels of tiredness is too much to ask. 
My goal is to have step-by-step instructions I can follow to make producing a home made meal as easy as ordering a takeaway.
* If I'm heading home and I'm hungry, I want to shop on the way instead of first consulting my cookbooks at home. 
I don't want to be limited by the recipes I've memorised, as this limits the diversity of nutrients I get from food. 
I copy-paste the ingredient list from here into my shopping list, tick off the items I know I have in my kitchen, and done!
* I optimise recipes for speed and for using less items that I'll need to wash afterwards. 
I convert all amounts into grams, even for liquids, so I can add everything into a container on the scales, without dirtying any measuring devices. 
I don't want to re-optimise a recipe from another website every time I decide to make it. 

If you find this online collection useful, please [send me one high-return-on-investment recipe](mailto:hello@karina.io) as a token of gratitude!

Full disclosure - I don't like cooking. I would much rather spend my time exercising or reading, while somebody else cooks for me. What I do like is fresh, tasty food that makes my body happy. Home cooked food is just so much better than supermarket or restaurant food, that I am ready to cook for it.

Here I want to share my favourite recipes. My goal is not to create the most amazing dish possible, I am ready to compromise on presentation and even on a bit of flavour to achieve my main objective - a meal that I can make from raw ingredients, quickly and without wasting food. I try not to buy anything that has an ingredient list, with some obvious exceptions like pasta and chocolate. If a recipe could be improved with one spoon of an ingredient that I am not likely to use for any other dishes, I am happy to skip it to avoid binning the rest of the jar later.

In my freezer I have a bag of home-cooked chickpeas, a pre-cut loaf of sourdough bread and a bag of peeled garlic cloves. Using these as a quick source of proteins, carbs and flavour, I can buy any vegetable on my way home and have something to eat ready in 5 minutes. When I do have the time and energy to make something better, I make these recipes that I'd love to share with you.


Please bear with me, I'll upload the recipes as soon as possible...

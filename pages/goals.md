I am currently working towards several goals.


<div class="row">
  {% for widget in page.widgets %}
    {% assign loopindex = forloop.index | modulo: 3 %}
    <div id="{{ widget.anchor }}">{% include _frontpage-widget.html widget=widget %}</div>
    {% if loopindex == 0 %}
  <hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" /> <!-- Prevents long first column items from pushing new rows to the right -->
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

  title: Never stop making friends
  dates: Since Apr 2018
  text: I've noticed that at a certain age people stop making new friends. I realised that some day I might lose my ability to strike up a conversation with a stranger and grow it into a friendship. To avoid that, I decided to meet at least a couple of new people every week. <a href="https://lunchclub.com/" target="_blank">Lunchclub</a> has been a huge help. Apart from making new friends, this has changed my perspective on the world.

I fell in love with Mexico City during my two weeks there. Spending time in bustling cities in India makes me happy. London is the true love of my life. My goal is to visit all cities with over 5 million people.

  dates: May 2018 - Sep 2018
  text: Ever wondered what the superhost label means on AirBnB? At the moment in my life when I was living alone and had flexible work hours, I decided to find out! It was a fun journey of meeting people from different walks of life, chatting late into the night over a bottle of wine, surprising my guests with a smell of pancakes in the morning. I got the superhost label!

  title: Never stop making friends
  dates: Since Apr 2018
  text: I've noticed that at a certain age people stop making new friends. I realised that some day I might lose my ability to strike up a conversation with a stranger and grow it into a friendship. To avoid that, I decided to meet at least a couple of new people every week. <a href="https://lunchclub.com/" target="_blank">Lunchclub</a> has been a huge help. Apart from making new friends, this has changed my perspective on the world.

  title: <a href="/travel-stories/cities/" target="_self">Visit world's biggest cities</a>
  dates: Since Jun 2009
  text: I am a big city addict. I only truly feel alive when I live in a big city. Exploring Tokyo was a breathtaking passionate affair with this city like no other. I fell in love with Mexico City during my two weeks there. Spending time in bustling cities in India makes me happy. London is the true love of my life. My goal is to visit all cities with over 5 million people.

  title: Have my own Meetup
  dates: Jun 2019 - Feb 2021
  text: I created the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-PyTorch-Meetup/" target="_blank">London PyTorch Meetup</a> together with <a href="https://www.mindstream-ai.com" target="_blank">Paul Dowling</a>. Our aim was to provide a platform where London-based machine learning professionals can share their experiences, make new friends, find advice and initiate collaborations. After 15 events both in person and online the group grew to more than 1000 members.

  title: Become a superhost
  dates: May 2018 - Sep 2018
  text: Ever wondered what the superhost label means on AirBnB? At the moment in my life when I was living alone and had flexible work hours, I decided to find out! It was a fun journey of meeting people from different walks of life, chatting late into the night over a bottle of wine, surprising my guests with a smell of pancakes in the morning. I got the label.

  title: <a href="/goals/phd/" target="_self">Get a PhD</a>
  dates: Sep 2015 - Sep 2019
  text: My academic background is in mathematics. My PhD thesis was on applications of machine learning to transcriptomics, with a chapter on de novo evolution of proteins. Based on my experience, <a href="/goals/phd/" target="_self">here</a> is my advice on how to select the right PhD, make the most of it, pass your viva and finally make the most of your new title.

  text: I've visited 40 countries so far. I avoid hotels when possible and I dislike tourist attractions. For me travelling is about exploring nature, architecture, cuisines and cultures around the world. Instead of visiting art galleries, I prefer to go for a walk looking for graffiti art. At night I prefer to wander around a busy port instead of pub crawling.

  text: I love the feeling of being in the middle of nowhere. Camping deep in a desert and hiking from the last stop of a rarely used train line are amongst the happiest memories I have. But in the long term, I only truly feel alive when I live in a big city. I'd love to spend some time living in Mexico City, Singapore and Mumbai. My goal is to visit all cities with over 5 million people.

  text: I spent 8 years in academia - a BSc in mathematics that I never finished, an MSc in mathematics and finally a PhD at UCL. If you are considering whether to do a PhD or if you are already doing one and feeling stuck, go get in touch. I'm good at asking the right questions to help you figure out what is right for you.

<h1>Hello world!</h1>

My name is Karina. 
I am originally from Latvia. 
As soon as I was allowed to fly by myself, I moved to Canada. 
I remember that day when I landed in Toronto Pearson Airport with all of my belongings, no money and barely speaking any English.
My first thought was - should have planned it better.
It was a difficult start, but it turned out to be an exciting journey.
Since then I've lived in Scotland, Finland and the US.
Now London is my home, though I spend less than half of my time there.
I am happiest when outdoors.
Mathematician at heart, I think about any situation as a system of equations.
Here are four fun facts about me:
